# WashRoute — Project Notes
*Last updated: Apr 21, 2026 — Session 132: Orders-page payment-icon flash fix (two passes) + New Customer modal: replaced dead Individual/Business radio with real Price List + Billing Type dropdowns + POS PIN management + POS customer-facing tip flow. **(A) Payment-icon flash, pass 1 (`e0ec612`):** Orders → List painted every Delivery customer with the "No card on file" warning icon on first open; icons self-corrected after a tab switch (~seconds later). Root cause in `admin-dashboard/index.html` `loadOrders()`: the Phase-2 side-fetch that populates `_custWithCard` was firing a re-render gated to `currentOrderFilter === 'issues'` only, so Scheduled / In Process / Ready tabs never re-rendered after the cache filled. Widened the gate to `currentPage === 'orders'`. Fixed the flash but left a ~1s visible lag. **(B) Payment-icon flash, pass 2 (`3ab5475`):** restructured `loadOrders()` to fetch the card cache (`customer_payment_methods`, 778 rows / 742 distinct customers — small enough for a full unfiltered query) **in parallel with** the orders query via `Promise.all`, then populate `_custWithCard` + `_custCardAddedAt` **before** the first `renderOrders()` call. Cache reset moved ahead of the await. Result: icons render correctly on frame one — no flash, no lag. Side-fetch still runs for SMS/email request history (Issues tab only); its re-render was narrowed back to `currentOrderFilter === 'issues'` since cards are no longer pending. Blast-radius check: `_custWithCard` is admin-only (driver + customer apps don't reference it); the realtime INSERT handler on `customer_payment_methods` is idempotent with the Set, so the reset-before-await is race-safe. **(C) New Customer modal — Individual/Business radio replaced (`be8d40d`):** Audit of `customers.account_type` showed the field was purely decorative — no DB function, trigger, view, RLS policy, edge function, or app-code branch reads it anywhere across admin/driver/customer/POS. Proof in the data: the 8 non-individual customers were labeled interchangeably as `commercial` (4) / `business` (3) / `standard` (1), inconsistent because the field wasn't load-bearing. Removed the radio and the `highlightCtype()` helper + dead `.ctype-active` CSS. Replaced with a real **Pricing & Billing** section between Service Address and Plan & Referral: `Price List` (Delivery / Commercial) + `Billing Type` (Automatic / On Account) dropdowns, with an explanatory note that reveals when On Account is picked. Previously `saveCustomer()` hardcoded `pricelist: 'Delivery'` and never set `billing_type`, forcing a manual fix-up in the customer panel after creation for every commercial / on-account customer. `account_type` column left in place (NOT NULL default `'individual'` handles the insert silently); can be dropped in a later migration once external consumers (Stripe tags, Excel exports) are confirmed clean.*

*Prior: Apr 20, 2026 — Session 131 (pt 5): POS live on custom domain + staging banner retired. **DNS:** added a CNAME in Wix for `pos` → `cname.vercel-dns.com` (same target as `app` and `driver`). Saved + propagated in under a minute. **Vercel:** `pos.familylaundry.com` was already registered as a domain on the washroute project from a prior session, waiting on DNS; the moment the Wix record went live Vercel picked it up and provisioned the Let's Encrypt SSL cert automatically (~5 min). **Routing:** `vercel.json` rewrite rule `{ "has": [{ "type": "host", "value": "pos.familylaundry.com" }], "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/pos/index.html" }` was already in place from the POS v1 deploy (session 125), so hitting `pos.familylaundry.com/` transparently serves `/pos/index.html` with the URL bar staying pretty. No code changes to vercel.json needed. **Banner:** removed the orange STAGING banner from `pos/index.html` (element `#staging-banner` at line 1447 — "REMOVE BANNER AFTER FIRST LIVE TEST SALE" per session 125's TODO). Blast-radius grep for `staging-banner` / `staging_banner` / `stagingBanner` came back empty — no JS referenced the id, so removal is clean. **Side observation flagged non-urgent:** Vercel's Domains page shows "DNS Change Recommended" yellow badges on `admin`, `driver`, and `app` (CNAME → A record upgrade advisory). Purely optional, sites all work fine; queued for a rainy day. **Commit:** `b9c22c4`.*

*Prior: Apr 20, 2026 — Session 131 (pt 4): Ownership migration — Supabase + GitHub + Vercel all transferred from dmacquart personal accounts to the LUCANINA organization / david@lucanina.com. **Supabase:** project `umjpbuxrdydwejqtensq` moved to org `aksnspvkrdvjuwjeylip` owned by david@lucanina.com; project URL, anon key, Secrets, and all data preserved (no regeneration needed). The Supabase MCP token tied to dmacquart lost permission (diagnostic: `list_projects` still saw the project but `execute_sql` returned "You do not have permission"); reconnected via OAuth under david@lucanina.com and verified with a live read query (2,398 orders, most recent today at 12:02 PM PT). **GitHub:** four repos (`washroute`, `w9-backend`, `boxit`, `W9creator`) transferred from `dmacquart` personal account to `LUCANINA` org. GitHub auto-redirects the old URLs, but the local git remote was updated to `https://github.com/LUCANINA/washroute.git`; verified via `git fetch` + `git push`. **Vercel:** the GitHub webhook broke on transfer — Vercel Settings → Git showed "dmacquart/washroute — Error: Project Link not found." Clicked the red Reconnect button, re-authorized the Vercel GitHub App on the LUCANINA org, and re-linked to `LUCANINA/washroute`. Verified with an empty test commit (`da47616`): Vercel built and promoted to production in 5 seconds, confirming the auto-deploy pipeline is fully re-established. **Doc updates:** `PROJECT-NOTES.md` session-111 note + `WashRoute-Laptop-Setup.md` clone URL both now point at `LUCANINA/washroute`. **Non-urgent hygiene item flagged for later:** the git remote URL still has a PAT embedded — swap for a credential helper (`gh auth login` or macOS Keychain) when convenient; works fine for now but is visible in any screenshot of `git remote -v`. **Commits today (migration only):** `cacc2f8` (doc URL update), `da47616` (webhook test).*

*Prior: Apr 20, 2026 — Session 131 (pt 3): Orders → Map now defaults to the current shift + skill archives refreshed with session 131 learnings. **Map default fix (admin-dashboard/index.html):** `rccAutoOpenSlotRoutes` previously auto-opened every route with pending stops regardless of AM/PM, which meant on first load the map dumped both shifts on the screen and the AM/PM chip toggle was effectively useless. It now filters templates by the current `_rccSlot` using the same `window_start < 12` / `window_end > 12` rule the chip strip uses — long templates (e.g. COMMERCIAL 9AM–3PM) still open in either bucket. Second fix on the same function: the default slot was using `new Date().getHours()`, which violates the mandatory `BIZ_TZ` rule; now uses `toLocaleString('en-US', {timeZone: BIZ_TZ, hour12:false})` so the AM/PM default is correct regardless of the browser's clock. Effect: log in before noon PT → only AM routes auto-open; after noon PT → only PM. Flip via toggle any time. **Skill archive refresh (4 files in repo root):** `washroute.skill` — added the new capacity-model guardrail section (soft override vs hard block + `stop_limit = 0 = dedicated commercial route` convention), added `orders.overcap_booking` to Key Tables, logged session 131 in Completed Features + Recently Completed. `washroute-audit.skill` — Check 7 (Over-Capacity Routes) now filters `stop_limit > 0` so commercial templates can't false-positive, and distinguishes `soft_override` (informational) from `hard_block` (investigate). `washroute-preflight.skill` — appended the 77-rows-collapsing-to-3 case study as a live example of the widespread-issue rule. `washroute-qa.skill` — synced with the live skill: added the DB trigger / function impact check in Step 2 and the root-cause-prevention bullet in Pattern consistency. Commit `40bf09d`.*

*Prior: Apr 20, 2026 — Session 131 (pt 2): Kidango / commercial-route protection + backfill of real San Francisco overcap. After Phase 2 went live, a backfill attempt surfaced that Kidango (and any future dedicated commercial template) uses `route_templates.stop_limit = 0` as a "no cap, this is a special route" convention. The three Phase 2 functions only guarded with `IS NOT NULL`, so `0` was interpreted as "limit 0" and every Kidango stop would have been flagged as overcap. Patched all four check sites (`auto_route_order` × 2, `sync_pickup_stop_on_window_change`, `sync_delivery_stop_on_window_change`) to also require `> 0`. Migration `session_131_phase2_skip_stop_limit_zero`. After David updated several route limits live, the only genuine overcap was San Francisco 4/20 (+2) and 4/21 (+3) = 3 distinct orders (same orders spanned both runs because their pickup/delivery fall on consecutive SF days). Backfilled `overcap_booking = TRUE` on those 3 orders so the Orders → Map chips light up. Snapshot preserved at `public._backfill_overcap_20260420` for reversibility. Widespread-issue rule triggered correctly — first backfill pass flagged 77 stops (64 Kidango false positives), caught on preflight review, re-scoped to the real 3. New ⚠️ guardrail below on the commercial-route convention. Prior session 131 work (three phases of the permanent overcapacity solution) was committed in `845e0b2`; this follow-up is a separate commit.*

*Prior: Apr 20, 2026 — Session 131: Permanent overcapacity solution — three complementary phases. Problem statement: customers booking into a "full" sub-window sometimes silently failed to route (stop stranded with `routing_error`) and sometimes silently overrode the limit without any indication, leaving Command Center chips showing wrong counts. David's rule: **"If we can present an actionable alternative to the customer, apply the overcapacity rule. If the customer is blind to what is happening, override the overcapacity constraint."** Implemented as three phases in one session. **Phase 2 — Safe overrides (DB-side, system-initiated routing accepts up to 125%):** added `orders.overcap_booking BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE` column + partial index (migration `session_131_phase2_overcap_booking_column` + `session_131_phase2_ceiling_in_auto_route_order` + the two window-sync functions). Three functions now use `v_sub_ceiling := GREATEST(v_sub_limit+1, FLOOR(v_sub_limit*1.25))` as a soft cap: `auto_route_order` (initial routing), `sync_pickup_stop_on_window_change` (pickup reschedule), `sync_delivery_stop_on_window_change` (delivery reschedule). Outcomes per path: under limit → `overcap_booking=FALSE, routing_error=NULL`; over limit but under 125% ceiling → `overcap_booking=TRUE, routing_error=NULL` (advisory); over 125% ceiling → `overcap_booking=TRUE, routing_error='over_capacity_severe*'` (hard block, stop stranded). This means staff always see the flag, but soft-overrides don't strand stops. **Phase 1 — Observability (admin Command Center):** RCC chips now show an orange "+N over" badge next to the zone count when any stop has `overcap_booking=TRUE`. New CSS `.rcc-chip-overcap` uses `--clr-attention` (orange), matches existing chip visual grammar. `_dsOvercapMap` state var populated alongside count map from the same query (`orders(status, overcap_booking)`). `buildChip()` renders `overcapBadge` conditionally. Drag-drop updates both maps atomically so the badge stays in sync. Order panel shows an orange banner "booked over capacity" + a soft ▲ icon in the order row (only when `routing_error IS NULL`, so the existing red error badge still wins for hard blocks). Four SELECT sites updated to include `overcap_booking`: main orders list, two route_stops joins, drag-drop sync. Driver app unaffected (correctly scoped — drivers don't need this). **Phase 3 — Booking alternatives (customer app):** new RPC `get_nearest_available_slots(p_zone_id, p_preferred_date, p_preferred_time, p_stop_type, p_limit=3, p_day_radius=2)` returns the N nearest actually-open sub-windows around the customer's preferred time for the right stop type. Mirrors `get_slot_availability` math for consistency but filters by `stop_type` (cleaner than the legacy combined count). Migration `session_131_phase3_nearest_slots_volatile_fix`. Customer app scheduler now calls this RPC whenever the customer taps a full slot or when no slots exist for the chosen day, then renders 3 tap-to-select chips. QA hardening pre-commit: (a) stale-RPC-response race → token guard via `data-token` attribute; response handler bails if token mismatch; (b) past-cutoff slots → filter with 30-min buffer against `nowMs`; (c) delivery turnaround violation → filter to `draft._deliveryOptions` set when `which === 'delivery'`. Window-object matcher fixed: `w.routeId === row.template_id` (window objects use `routeId` as template ID via `computeSubWindows`). Sanity-check script at `tests/session131_overcap.test.js`. New ⚠️ guardrail below on the soft-ceiling invariant. No other callers of these three functions exist; blast radius clean across all apps + edge functions. Security advisor reports existing WARN `function_search_path_mutable` on the new RPC (matches every other function in the project — not a regression).*

*Prior: Session 130: Null-coord address root-cause fix + missing-coords warning banner + map fullscreen mode + several RCC polish items. (A) **Null-coord addresses (Carol Stevenson missing map pin)**: Audit surfaced 6 customers with NULL lat/lng on their addresses (Carol Stevenson, Jennifer Evans, Paula Murphy, Henrike Lange, Dominic Volpatti, Karen White) — they were invisible on the Orders → Map view and drivers got no turn-by-turn directions. Data heal: David ran `geocodeMissing()` in the browser console, which successfully geocoded all 6 via the existing Google Maps client geocoder and saved lat/lng back to `addresses`. Root cause trace found **4 INSERT paths** to `addresses` that silently saved nulls when Google Maps failed — the March customer import path just saved whatever came back, and three other flows fell through to `.insert({ lat: null, lng: null })` when the Places Autocomplete picker was skipped. All 4 paths now guarded: `saveIntake()` + `saveNewAddress()` in `admin-dashboard/index.html` (confirm dialog "could not verify this address — save anyway?"); `_geocodeFallback()` helper + `saveAddressForm()` + order-placement flow in `customer-app/index.html` (Google geocoder fallback if autocomplete was skipped, then hard block if still no coords). Added ⚠️ guardrail below. (B) **Missing-coords warning banner** in admin Orders → Map: the RCC render loop now collects any route_stops whose address has null coords into `missing[]` and shows a yellow banner "N stops not on map — [Fix now]" across the top of the map; the button calls `rccFixMissingCoords()` which batch-geocodes + refreshes affected routes. Code at `admin-dashboard/index.html` line 18563-18664. (C) **Map fullscreen mode**: Orders → Map now has a Maximize button (top-right of the date bar) that toggles `body.map-fullscreen`, which hides the sidebar, topbar, and List/Map tabs and stretches the map to 100vh. Escape key exits; navigating away auto-resets. CSS at line 134-142, HTML at 1574-1583, JS at 18729-18760. Also resets on `showPage()` + `switchOrdersView('orders')` so the class can't get stuck on. Commits `229f14a` + `34f3401`. (D) Earlier in session: driver_id override clearing when moving a stop to another route + DB trigger guard (`889b4c7`), AM/PM toggle + chip shrink on Map view (`862c9b6`), progress-bar and "X done" badge removal from RCC column headers (`486854f`, `3319b33`), discrete en-route tag on stop cards (`16a145f`), en-route stops now included in ETA auto-refresh + optimize gating (`79b3bc3`), driver-app auto-reload when an inherited-stop (driver_id=NULL) is moved onto my route (`4622524`), empty-string profile-write guard for customer name cache (`bf7774f`).*

*Prior: Session 129: Failed-delivery SMS bug + Baby Lee zone override poisoning + Route optimizer HTTP 401 fix. Two issues surfaced from one customer text: Baby Lee received a "we couldn't pick up your laundry" SMS after a failed **delivery** attempt. (A) Wrong SMS copy: `driver-app/index.html` `cantCompleteStop()` always wrote `orders.status = 'pickup_failed'` regardless of `stop_type`, which (i) triggered the pickup-failed template on delivery failures and (ii) broke the recurring chain for failed deliveries (the recurring trigger fires on `status='pickup_failed'`). Fixed by branching on `isPickup` — delivery failures now write `status='delivery_failed'`. Added new `delivery_failed` row to `message_templates` (sort_order 36, sms_enabled=true) + explicit EVENT_TO_TRIGGER mapping in `send-order-notification` v28. Also replaced `auto_fail_expired_orders` cron fn so it selects the right template per stop type (was previously only using the pickup body for both). Committed 320307b. (B) Baby's next recurring order #2672 was routed to COMMERCIAL even though her `route_template_override_id` points to Alameda PM. Traced to a manual mis-booking on Apr 10 — the New Order modal in the admin dashboard copies `route_template.zone_id` onto the order's zone_id field, and `trg_create_recurring_order_fn` then blindly copied `NEW.zone_id` (Commercial) forward on every recurring cycle. Data fix: moved #2672 from COMMERCIAL to Alameda PM (Apr 24 18:00-20:00 PT pickup, Apr 29 18:00-20:00 PT delivery), fixed stale `zone_id` on #2673 (stops already on Alameda PM from David's manual reschedule). Systemic prevention: replaced `trg_create_recurring_order_fn` to re-resolve `zone_id` from the override template whenever a customer has one set. Blast-radius check: Baby was the only affected customer. Root cause in New Order modal (admin-dashboard/index.html line 14701 — `zone_id: _noSelectedTmpl?.zone_id || null`) is flagged below as the next follow-up. (C) Route Command Center "Optimize" button returned `Optimization failed: HTTP 401`. Root cause: `optimize-route` edge function had `verify_jwt: true`, which the Supabase gateway enforces before running function code. Two client-side fix attempts (adding `Authorization: Bearer ${SUPA_ANON_KEY}`, then switching to `session.access_token`) both still returned 401 — the gateway rejects the anon JWT on `verify_jwt:true` functions, and the function uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` internally anyway so gateway auth adds no security value. Real fix: redeployed `optimize-route` v22 with `verify_jwt: false`, matching every other edge function in the project (cloudprnt, send-receipt, charge-order, stripe-terminal — same pattern used to fix the identical bug in session 125). Client-side `session.access_token` additions remain but are now redundant (harmless). Added ⚠️ guardrail below.*

*Prior: Session 128: Credit ledger integrity fix — three silent "disappearing tips / disappearing credits" bugs in the admin dashboard + 636-row backfill. Triggered by Katie Guadagno's account: $150 credits added, two orders ($68.95 + $77.95 w/ overage), balance showed $3.10 but one of the orders rendered as "$0 Paid" with no ledger row. Deep audit found three code-level holes: (1) `saveIntake()` deducted `customers.credits` without writing a matching `customer_transactions` row — Transactions tab drifted from balance for every intake that applied a credit; (2) `saveRacking()`'s fully-credited branch (subtotal=$0 after intake credit) only stamped `stripe_payment_intent_id='credit_applied'` and skipped `billing_status`, `billing_payment_method`, `paid_at`, producing 12 "zombie-$0" orders; if the order also carried a tip, the tip vanished (neither charged nor deducted); (3) Bill Orders → Account Credit summed pre-tip `total_amount`, so tips were excluded from the credit deduction and per-order event log. Fixes in `admin-dashboard/index.html` (commit 4090df1): saveIntake now inserts a `credit_use` row with `description='Applied to order #N at Intake'`; saveRacking's no-subtotal branch computes `tipDollars = _orderTipBreakdown().dollars` and either deducts from credits + logs ledger, or routes to `charge-order` edge function (which applies creditsApplied=0 + charges tip to card), or sets `billing_status='failed'` so the tip surfaces in Issues; Bill Orders now sums `_orderTipBreakdown(o).totalWithTip` and per-order event log records subtotal+tip. Backfill (idempotent): 636 missing `credit_use` rows inserted across 377 customers totalling $13,766.80 of intake-time deductions (description `Applied to order #N at Intake (backfill)`); 12 zombie orders updated to `billing_status='paid'` / `billing_payment_method='credit'` / `paid_at=NOW()`. Katie's ledger now reconciles exactly: $150 in − $146.90 out = $3.10 balance ✓. Out-of-scope finding flagged for follow-up: 278 credit-card-paid orders are missing `paid_at` because `charge-order/index.ts` + two other admin paths (`admin-dashboard/index.html` lines 16007, 16121) never set it — pre-existing, unrelated to credits.*

*Prior: Session 127: Orphan auth fix follow-up. (1) Manually deleted two blocking orphan auth users that had accumulated before the nightly cron existed: `mcrouch72@gmail.com` (blocking Melissa Crouch, 18 orders / $2,340 LTV) and `carrie@massagelogic.com` (blocking Carrie Stone / Massage Logic, 2 orders / $4,780 LTV). Both customers verified intact — phone-auth profiles, orders, and Stripe cards untouched. (2) Diagnosed cron gap: `cleanup_orphan_email_auth_users` (job 15) only had its FIRST run today (Apr 18 at 10:00 UTC). The job was created in Session 123 but had never fired before, meaning March orphans were never swept. Additionally, the function's `AND auth.identities.provider = 'email'` filter was too strict — Supabase magic-link flows can store provider as `'email'` or `'magiclink'` depending on client version, so some orphans silently survived the query. Fixed: deployed updated function that drops the identity-provider check and relies solely on `au.email IS NOT NULL + no customer link + not staff + >24h old`. (3) Updated `washroute-audit.skill` Check 12 exclusion list — added `pos-foothill@familylaundry.com` (Foothill POS staff, session 125) and `preeandrew@gmail.com` (driver Andrew Pree) so they stop appearing as false-positives in morning rounds. Skill archive presented for one-click reinstall.*

*Prior: Session 126: Retail SMS pipeline for walk-in drop-offs. Two client-triggered texts now fire from the POS: (1) "order placed" confirmation the moment a laundry drop-off is charged and saved (status = `processing`), and (2) "your laundry is ready for pickup" when an attendant taps **Mark Ready** on the walk-in queue card (status transition `processing` → `ready_for_delivery`). Merchandise-only sales stay silent. Added two rows to `message_templates` (`walkin_order_placed`, `walkin_order_ready`) so David can edit copy or flip the live kill-switch from the admin dashboard's Notifications editor. Added RLS policy `pos_read_message_templates` so the POS authenticated (non-admin) session can read templates scoped by `pos_session_active()`. New helper `sendPosTemplateSms()` in `pos/index.html` handles template lookup, `{{first_name}}` + `{{order_number}}` substitution, E.164 phone normalization, and fire-and-forget invocation of `send-sms` (a Twilio hiccup never blocks a sale). Browser-console smoke test at `tests/test-walkin-sms.js`. Customer-required gate from session 114 guarantees every laundry queue card already has a customer with a phone, so the ready-for-pickup hook always has what it needs. Commit `88040b7`.*

*Prior: Session 125: POS v1 deployed to Vercel at washroute.vercel.app/pos. Fixed two blockers after push: (1) Foothill staff auth user had NULL token columns from direct SQL creation, throwing "Database error querying schema" on login — patched to empty strings (known Supabase Go scan bug). (2) `stripe-terminal` edge function had `verify_jwt: true`, which returned 401 from the gateway before the function code ran — flipped to `verify_jwt: false` to match cloudprnt/send-receipt/charge-order, redeployed v7. Card payment on S700 reader verified end-to-end with David's PIN (6467). Cash drop-off + reprint smoke tests deferred to next week when mC-Print3 is hooked up. STAGING banner stays up until those pass.*

*Prior: Session 124: Jennifer Fatzler duplicate-customer merge. After session 123's orphan cleanup, Jennifer had two customer rows — legacy `ad2bef79…` (6 Starchup-imported orders, `profile_id=NULL`, uppercase email, old phone) and new `af2a687a…` (1 order today, phone-auth linked, current email/phone, Stripe card on file). Merged surgically: re-pointed orders + addresses + payment method + email/sms messages to the legacy id; copied current profile_id, stripe IDs, card fields, preferences into legacy; deleted the new row. Snapshot of every touched row preserved in `public._merge_backup_jennifer_20260417`. Jennifer now has a single record with legacy tenure (since Mar 2025), 7 total orders, $481.70 lifetime value, and her current phone-auth login. New **🔀 Customer Merges Log** section added to this file as the canonical registry for all past and future customer merges.*

*Prior: Session 123: Permanent fix for orphan email-auth users (4 layers). Root cause: `send-magic-link` v17 called `auth.admin.generateLink()` unconditionally, silently spawning orphan email-auth users whenever the entered email didn't match an existing customer with a `profile_id` — which then blocked the real customer from signing in. Session 117 had fixed signup-form orphans via `check_account_exists`, but missed this path. Four-layer fix: (1) **v18 edge function** — refuses before creating an orphan, returns `{ok:false, noAccount:true, legacyCustomer?:true}`; (2) **customer app UX** — `handleMagicLink()` + `handleOtpEmailFallback()` now show purpose-built "No account — Sign Up" / "Use phone sign-in" banners instead of generic error toasts; (3) **admin dashboard** — `sendAppInvite()` was checking `res.ok` instead of `json.ok`, showing false "Sent!" for 4,170 legacy customers; fixed to surface a helpful toast explaining they need to sign in by phone first; (4) **nightly cron** — `cleanup_orphan_email_auth_users()` SECURITY DEFINER function + pg_cron at 0 10 UTC (3 AM PDT), deletes email-provider auth users >24h old with no customer and no staff role, capped at 50/run. Cleaned up 4 existing orphans (wlockhart, sonnygrewal, mattkyan, fatzler).*

*Prior: Session 122: S700 card reader live + POS refunds. Stripe S700 smart reader connected and tested end-to-end with real card payments (Visa + Amex). Rewrote POS card flow from client-side Terminal JS SDK to server-driven approach (edge function pushes payment to reader via Stripe API, POS polls for completion). Added POS refund flow: recent sales list → confirm → full refund via Stripe. Also patched `auto_route_order` root cause for window/sub-window misalignment (both pickup + delivery sides now snap to sub-window boundaries). `stripe-terminal` edge function v5 deployed.*

*Prior: Session 120: Critical subscription webhook bug fix. Root cause: `subscriptions_status_check` constraint only allowed active/paused/cancelled/past_due, but Stripe sends `incomplete` on `customer.subscription.created`. The upsert silently failed (200 OK to Stripe, no row created). Fix: expanded constraint to include all Stripe statuses (incomplete, incomplete_expired, trialing, unpaid) via migration `expand_subscriptions_status_check_for_stripe`. Also added `SUBSCRIPTIONS_ENABLED = false` feature flag to customer-app gating all 8 subscription UI touchpoints — prevents real customers from seeing/using subscriptions until launch. Cleaned up 2 orphaned customer records (Ashley Thompson, Sandeep Vadivel) who completed checkout during the bug window. Deployed clean `stripe-webhook` v37.*

*Prior: Session 119: Subscription Phases 7+8. Phase 7: Failed Payment Recovery — 7-day grace period dunning flow via `stripe-webhook` v34 (escalating SMS+email notifications, Stripe `cancel_at`, customer app past_due banner). Phase 8: Subscription Analytics — 4 sub-tabs added to Reports > Subscriptions: Overview (existing table), At-Risk (rule-based churn signals: past_due, paused, zero/low usage, cancel pending), Upgrade Candidates (near weight/pickup limits, overage balance), Usage Trends (Chart.js fleet charts from `subscription_usage_log` + per-subscriber usage table with days-left). Also fixed duplicate subscriptions tab HTML.*

*Prior: Session 118: Subscription Phases 5+6. Phase 5: auto-pickup (day picker, first recurring order, manual order linking, charge-order v36 subscription guard). Phase 6: mid-cycle cancellation overage billing — `stripe-webhook` v32 creates standalone Stripe invoice on `customer.subscription.deleted` when `overage_amount_due > 0`. Also restored `invoice.created` handler from session 115 (was deployed but never committed). v32 QA fixes: idempotency keys on both `invoiceItems.create` and `invoices.create`, `pending_invoice_items_behavior: 'exclude'` to prevent sweeping unrelated items, and atomic overage claim guards on both handlers to prevent double-billing race conditions.*

*Prior: Session 117: Orphan auth user root-cause fix. Full audit of all 9 auth-user-creating paths across customer app, admin dashboard, driver app, and edge functions. Root cause: both signup forms (`handleSignup` + checkout) called `db.auth.signUp()` directly — returning customers with phone-auth accounts created duplicate email auth users with no customer record, blocking sign-in. Fix: `check_account_exists()` SECURITY DEFINER RPC pre-checks both signup paths; deleted stale `index 2.html` backup with zero orphan prevention. Cleaned 10 orphan auth users (6 blocking real customers). All paths now protected.*

*Prior: Session 116: SMS opt-out desync fix. Audit Check #9 flagged 26 customers in a NULL/NULL limbo state (phone present, neither `sms_consent_at` nor `sms_marketing_opt_out_at` set) — outbound SMS silently blocked for them. Root cause: admin "Add Customer" insert in `admin-dashboard/index.html` omitted `sms_consent_at`. Patched the insert to stamp `now()` when a phone is provided, and backfilled all 26 existing rows with `created_at` as consent timestamp. Audit #9 now clean.*

*Prior: Session 115: Subscriptions Phase 4 — overage auto-billing. Deployed `stripe-webhook` v30 with `invoice.created` handler that attaches `overage_amount_due` as a Stripe `invoice_item` to the draft renewal invoice (idempotency key `overage-${sub.id}-${invoice.id}`, metadata flags, logged to `subscription_usage_log`). David added `invoice.created` to the Stripe webhook endpoint in Dashboard. Added Audit Check #15 (stale subscription overage) to `washroute-audit.skill`.*

*Prior: Session 113: Delivery window / route template desync fix. Patched `auto_route_order` to sync order's `delivery_window_start/end` to the chosen template window after placing the delivery stop (was only used locally in the PM-bridging path, leaving AM windows on PM-routed orders). Bulk-resynced 153 active orders to match their actual assigned routes. Added Check #14 to daily audit. Root-cause: recurring trigger propagated bad arithmetic delivery windows inherited from old Starchup-imported parents; PM-bridging in auto_route_order silently routed them to PM routes without updating displayed windows — so customer-facing delivery times were wrong across the fleet.*

*Prior: Session 112 (extended): Notes model rewired (3-field), recurring dedup hardened, Processing Queue care-note fallback. Reports/Registrations tab added with KPIs + CSV. Daily Revenue: per-day expansion + today-only default. Card-state caches now accumulate across tabs (fixes stale "Request card" button). Rebrand: purple → vibrant blue (#3B82F6) including hardcoded uses across email, refunds, leaflet, kanban pills.*

## 📁 Repo Location (updated Mar 18, 2026)

Project moved from the old Cowork sandbox path to a proper local git repo:

- **New path:** `~/Projects/WashRoute`
- **Git:** Standard git commands (`git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, `git commit`, `git push`) all work normally — no workarounds needed.
- **Vercel:** Still auto-deploys on push to `main` (no change to hosting setup).

## Guiding Principle

Every session: Jony Ive and Steve Jobs attention to detail. No orphan code, no dead references, no hardcoded strings that should be configurable. Whether the customer sees it or not — the system must be tidy. Clean up after every job.

**⚠️ FIX PERMANENTLY, NOT JUST FOR NOW.** When fixing any bug or issue, always ask: "How do we make sure this can never happen again?" Every fix should come with a suggestion for structural prevention — a DB constraint, a trigger guard, a skill update, or a PROJECT-NOTES warning. Fixing the symptom is step 1. Making the bug impossible to reintroduce is step 2. If a field's meaning changes, check every consumer (app code AND DB triggers/functions). If a previous fix is being reversed, the ⚠️ CRITICAL warnings in this file exist for a reason — read them before changing related code.

**⚠️ DELIVERY WINDOWS MUST MATCH ROUTE TEMPLATES.** When creating orders, always check the route template's `arrival_window_hours` to determine the correct delivery window size. San Francisco and Hayward routes have 3-hour arrival windows (7–10 PM), so the delivery window is the full route window. Berkeley, Alameda, and Oakland routes have 2-hour arrival windows (sub-windows: 6–8 PM or 8–10 PM). Never assume all routes use the same window size. One-time orders use `recurring_interval = NULL` (not `'one_time'`).

**⚠️ BUSINESS TIMEZONE: Oakland CA, Pacific Time (`America/Los_Angeles`).** All "today" checks, stat cards, and date comparisons must use the `BIZ_TZ` constant (loaded from settings table at startup). Never assume UTC or browser local time.

**⚠️ ALL trigger functions that write to `route_stops` MUST be SECURITY DEFINER.** The `route_stops` table has RLS restricting writes to `is_admin()`. Trigger functions default to SECURITY INVOKER (caller's permissions). If a trigger running as a customer or system user tries to INSERT/UPDATE route_stops, it will silently fail — zero rows affected, no error. This caused the #1 recurring bug (wrong-date stops) across sessions 62-95, and also caused ghost stops (session 96). All 8 functions that write to route_stops are now SECURITY DEFINER: `auto_route_order`, `sync_pickup_stop_on_window_change`, `sync_delivery_stop_on_window_change`, `reconcile_stop_route_on_run_change`, `sync_stops_on_order_terminal`, `sync_stops_on_order_status_advance`, `reset_failed_delivery_stop`, `sync_stop_address_on_order_address_change`. Any new function that touches route_stops from a trigger context must be too.

**⚠️ `stop_limit = 0` MEANS "NO LIMIT / DEDICATED COMMERCIAL ROUTE" (session 131).** Kidango and any similarly-structured commercial template use `route_templates.stop_limit = 0` to opt out of the standard overcap system — these are dedicated, manually-managed routes where David assigns stops directly and normal capacity math doesn't apply. The three Phase 2 functions (`auto_route_order`, `sync_pickup_stop_on_window_change`, `sync_delivery_stop_on_window_change`) gate their overcap logic on `v_tmpl.stop_limit IS NOT NULL AND v_tmpl.stop_limit > 0`. If you add another stop-assigning function that checks capacity, use the same two-part guard — checking only `IS NOT NULL` would treat `0` as "limit = 0 → everything over cap." Also: if a daily audit or admin tool wants to show "routes at capacity," it should exclude `stop_limit <= 0` for the same reason. Convention: commercial / special routes → `stop_limit = 0`; normal routes with unlimited capacity (rare) → use `NULL` only if you truly want to skip all capacity tracking, including the sub-window count.

**⚠️ OVERCAPACITY HAS TWO DISTINCT STATES — don't conflate them (session 131).** After Phase 2, every stop-assigning DB function distinguishes three outcomes, keyed to the sub-window count vs. (a) `stop_limit` and (b) `v_sub_ceiling = GREATEST(stop_limit+1, FLOOR(stop_limit*1.25))`: **(1) under limit** → `overcap_booking=FALSE, routing_error=NULL`; **(2) over limit but under ceiling (soft override)** → `overcap_booking=TRUE, routing_error=NULL` — stop IS routed, flag is advisory; **(3) over ceiling (hard block)** → `overcap_booking=TRUE, routing_error='over_capacity_severe*'` — stop stranded, requires staff action. This means **`overcap_booking` is NOT an error** — it's an advisory badge. `routing_error` is the hard-blocker. UI code must treat them distinctly: the RCC overcap badge (orange) only renders when `overcap_booking=TRUE AND routing_error IS NULL`; the red error badge still wins when both are set. Three functions currently implement this: `auto_route_order` (uses local var `v_sub_ceiling`), `sync_pickup_stop_on_window_change` and `sync_delivery_stop_on_window_change` (use local var `v_route_ceiling` — same intent, different scope). If you add a fourth function that assigns/reassigns stops to routes, it MUST implement all three outcomes in the same order — don't just check the hard limit and call it done, or customers will hit "fully booked" messages when there's still soft-override capacity. The daily audit catches drift: any order with `overcap_booking=TRUE AND status='delivered'` is fine (historical); any with `overcap_booking=TRUE AND routing_error IS NOT NULL` should be investigated (something reassigned the stop without clearing the flag).

**⚠️ Reschedule sync triggers are hardened (session 98).** `sync_pickup_stop_on_window_change` and `sync_delivery_stop_on_window_change` have three additional structural protections on top of SECURITY DEFINER: (1) template `FOR` loops filter by time-of-day in the `WHERE` clause (not `ORDER BY`), so wrong-time templates can never be selected; (2) capacity is advisory — the stop is always moved and `routing_error = 'over_capacity_after_reschedule'` is set if the target route is over its `stop_limit`, so stops never get stranded on the old date; (3) if NO time-matching template exists, the trigger reverts `pickup_window_start`/`pickup_window_end` (or delivery equivalents) to `OLD` values and sets `routing_error = 'reschedule_no_matching_template'`, so a bad window change fails cleanly instead of leaving the order half-moved. When modifying these functions, preserve all three protections AND the `SECURITY DEFINER` attribute. The daily audit should surface any rows with `routing_error IN ('over_capacity_after_reschedule','reschedule_no_matching_template')`.

**⚠️ SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE FEATURE-FLAGGED OFF.** `customer-app/index.html` has `SUBSCRIPTIONS_ENABLED = false` (~line 1679) gating 8 touchpoints: home card, My Plan menu item, post-checkout redirect, plan cards rendering, startSubscription(), plan badge in account header, and two subscription queries. When ready to launch, flip to `true`. Do NOT remove the flag — just change the value. The flag also gates the acct-menu-plan-item visibility (starts `display:none` in HTML, shown via JS only when flag is true).

**⚠️ CREDIT LEDGER INVARIANT — every `customers.credits` write MUST be paired with a `customer_transactions` insert in the same code path (session 128).** The Transactions tab and customer balance both read from these two sources; if they drift, customers see "phantom credits" or "disappeared credits" and the audit trail is useless. There are currently 4 writers to `customers.credits` in `admin-dashboard/index.html` — all 4 now insert a ledger row immediately after the `.update({credits:…})` call. If you add a 5th writer, you MUST insert a `customer_transactions` row with: `type='credit_use'` (or `credit_add` / `credit_remove`), `amount=<delta>`, `description=<human-readable context>`, and ideally `order_id` + `payment_method`. The customer-app and driver-app must NEVER write to `customers.credits` directly — if a customer-facing flow ever needs to, route it through an edge function that handles the ledger atomically. Related: every order write that sets `billing_status='paid'` should also set `paid_at` (not just `billed_at`) — POS files get this right, several admin/edge paths do not (278 credit-card orders backfilled in session 128 follow-up TBD).

**⚠️ FULLY-CREDITED ORDERS WITH TIPS — tip money cannot silently disappear (session 128).** When an order's subtotal is zero because intake applied a credit line item, the tip is still owed and must go somewhere. `saveRacking()`'s fully-credited branch in `admin-dashboard/index.html` handles three paths: (1) remaining credit balance ≥ tip → deduct from credits + log `credit_use`; (2) remaining balance < tip → call `charge-order` edge function (which will charge only the tip since `total_amount=0` means `creditsApplied=0`); (3) charge-order fails → `billing_status='failed'` + `billing_notes` explaining why, so the tip surfaces in the Issues tab. Do NOT reintroduce the pre-session-128 shortcut that stamped `stripe_payment_intent_id='credit_applied'` and walked away — that path silently ate tips and left orders without `billing_status`, producing "zombie-$0" rows.

**⚠️ NEVER use `.toISOString()` for local date comparisons.** `toISOString()` returns UTC — after 5 PM Pacific it rolls to the next calendar day and breaks every "is this today?" check. Always use the `today()` helper or `getFullYear()/getMonth()/getDate()` formatting. This caused a critical bug where route schedule cells locked every evening. Applies to all three apps.

**⚠️ OVERRIDE-TEMPLATE IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR ZONE (session 129).** When `customers.route_template_override_id` is set, the override template's `zone_id` — not the order's own `zone_id` — must drive all downstream routing and recurrence. `trg_create_recurring_order_fn` now re-resolves `zone_id` from the override template before inserting the next cycle (prevents the Baby Lee bug: a single manual mis-booking poisoned every subsequent recurring order for weeks). When adding any new code path that creates, copies, or copies-forward an order for an override customer, resolve zone the same way — check `customers.route_template_override_id`, look up `route_templates.zone_id` from it, fall back to the computed zone only when no override exists. The dashboard's New Order modal (`admin-dashboard/index.html` ~line 14701 — `zone_id: _noSelectedTmpl?.zone_id || null`) is the next place to apply this rule: today it copies the template's zone onto the order even when the customer has a different override. Until that's patched, any admin who picks the wrong template on New Order can still poison a customer's zone — the recurring trigger will now heal it on the next cycle, but the first order will still route wrong. Daily audit catches this via the "override customer with mismatched order zone" query.

**⚠️ DRIVER-APP "CAN'T COMPLETE STOP" MUST BRANCH ON STOP TYPE (session 129).** `cantCompleteStop()` in `driver-app/index.html` originally hard-coded `orders.status = 'pickup_failed'` for both pickup and delivery failures. This caused two cascading bugs: (1) the outbound SMS template keyed off `pickup_failed`, so customers with a failed **delivery** received a "we couldn't pick up your laundry" text (wrong and confusing); (2) the recurring trigger fires on `pickup_failed` status — so failed deliveries were incorrectly spawning next-cycle orders while the customer's clean laundry was still at the facility. Fix: the function now branches on `isPickup` and writes `'pickup_failed'` or `'delivery_failed'` accordingly. Mirror this branching in any new "stop failed" code path. The `delivery_failed` template exists in `message_templates` (slug used by trigger_key, sms_enabled=true) and must stay enabled. `auto_fail_expired_orders` cron fn was also updated to read the right template body per stop type.

**⚠️ NEVER INSERT AN ADDRESS ROW WITH NULL `lat`/`lng` (session 130).** An address without coordinates is invisible on the Orders → Map view, doesn't get stops routed through optimizer distance calcs correctly, and drivers can't get turn-by-turn directions. There are currently **4 code paths that INSERT into `addresses`** — all 4 now guard against null coords: `admin-dashboard/index.html` `saveIntake()` (line ~14620) and `saveNewAddress()` (line ~15250) both show a `confirm()` dialog ("could not verify this address — save anyway?") and abort by default; `customer-app/index.html` `saveAddressForm()` (~line 5320) and the order-placement auto-save (~line 4554) both run a `_geocodeFallback()` Google-geocoder call first, and then hard-block with a toast if coords still can't be obtained. If you add a 5th writer, you MUST do the same. The admin path is allowed to save-anyway only on explicit user confirmation, because staff sometimes need to capture a bad address from a phone call and fix it later. The customer path does NOT have a save-anyway option — customers must pick a validated address. Daily audit also surfaces any `addresses` rows with null coords (Carol Stevenson bug — 6 rows were silently nulled during the March 23 Starchup import before this guard existed). The admin Orders → Map view renders a yellow "N stops not on map — [Fix now]" banner whenever the currently-loaded routes contain stops with null-coord addresses; the Fix-now button batch-geocodes via the existing client-side Google geocoder (`geocodeMissing()` / `rccFixMissingCoords()`) and refreshes the affected routes. Follow-up noted but not built: same silent-drop pattern may exist on Customers → Map (admin lines 7082, 19359) — lower priority since it's not customer-blocking. Also pending: DB-level safety net (edge function `geocode-address` + pg_net trigger on INSERT) as the final self-healing layer so a bug in any future 5th writer can't slip through.

**⚠️ DEPLOY ALL WASHROUTE EDGE FUNCTIONS WITH `verify_jwt: false` (sessions 125, 129).** Twice now — `stripe-terminal` (session 125) and `optimize-route` (session 129) — leaving `verify_jwt: true` (Supabase's default) caused the gateway to return HTTP 401 before the function code ran, even when the client sent `Authorization: Bearer <anon-JWT>` or `Authorization: Bearer <session.access_token>`. The Supabase gateway's JWT verifier rejects the legacy anon JWT outright, and user session tokens only work when a user is actually logged in — driver GPS pings, POS attendants, and RCC auto-optimize don't always have a user session. The correct pattern across this project is `verify_jwt: false` with the function implementing its own auth by using `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` server-side (checks `auth.getUser()` from the Authorization header, or validates input by other means — NEVER trusts client input blindly). Every existing edge function (`cloudprnt`, `send-receipt`, `charge-order`, `send-sms`, `send-order-notification`, `stripe-webhook`, `stripe-terminal`, `optimize-route` v22+, `send-magic-link`, etc.) follows this pattern. When deploying a new edge function via `apply_migration` / `deploy_edge_function`, always explicitly pass `verify_jwt: false`. If the function must be public (webhooks, Twilio callbacks), that's the same setting. The `apikey` header the client sends is still required by the gateway for rate limiting — keep sending it. Debugging lesson: if an edge function returns 401 with `execution_time_ms` around 50ms in `get_logs service=edge-function`, it's the gateway rejecting the JWT — check `verify_jwt` before chasing client-side header code. "Looks-right-in-diff" is not verification; deploy and check the Supabase logs.

| Card terminal | **Stripe S700** (WiFi, countertop) | ✅ Live (session 122). Registered as "Foothill Card Reader" (`tmr_Gd5THwTwVhTw3n`), location `tml_Gdo05A5djBbUyZ`, IP 192.168.7.62. Server-driven flow — edge function pushes payments to reader via Stripe API (no Terminal JS SDK). Tested with Visa + Amex. |

### Current printing setup (CloudPRNT — mC-Print3)
Receipt prints automatically — no user tap required. Full handshake built and deployed. Edge function converts Star Document Markup XML → Star Line Mode binary at serve time (v15, session 70i). The mC-Print3 firmware 5.2 does NOT support Star Document Markup natively — it only accepts `application/vnd.star.starprpt` (binary). v13 broke printing by serving raw XML as `text/vnd.star.markup`; v14 used wrong command set (Epson ESC/POS); v15 uses correct Star Line Mode commands (ESC E/F for bold, ESC GS a for alignment, ESC i for sizing, ESC d for cut, ESC b for barcodes). Includes Unicode→ASCII map for thermal printer compatibility.

**Printer setup (one-time):**
1. Connect mC-Print3 to WiFi, navigate to its IP in a browser → CloudPRNT settings
2. Set **Server URL** → `https://umjpbuxrdydwejqtensq.supabase.co/functions/v1/cloudprnt`
3. Note the **Token** (default = printer MAC address)
4. In Admin → Settings → Receipt Printer → paste token → Save
5. Click **🖨 Test Print** to verify

**How it works:** When `🖨 Print` is clicked (order panel or kanban Reprint) or intake is saved, the admin queues a job in the `print_jobs` table. The printer polls the `cloudprnt` Edge Function every few seconds, claims the job, prints Star Document Markup content, and reports back done. Falls back to browser popup if no token is configured.

### ✅ Twilio A2P 10DLC — Approved (2026-03-16)
Outbound SMS is fully live. A2P 10DLC registration was approved by US carriers on 2026-03-16. Messages no longer stuck in `queued` status.

Twilio credentials are stored in **Supabase Secrets** (rotated session 8 — no longer hardcoded):
- Account SID: `AC57c50cec278e5987a7a0d8d9443d1851`
- From number: `+15105884102`
- Webhook URL (set in Twilio Console): `https://umjpbuxrdydwejqtensq.supabase.co/functions/v1/twilio-webhook`

**⚠️ Important — two separate places store the Twilio Auth Token:**
1. **Supabase Secrets** (`TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`) — used by edge functions (`send-sms`, `notify-on-my-way`). Updated session 8.
2. **Supabase Auth → Authentication → Providers → Phone** — used by the customer app phone OTP login. This is a SEPARATE setting in the Supabase dashboard, not a secret. If the Twilio auth token is ever rotated again, **both** places must be updated or OTP login will break with error 20003.

| `charge-order` | Stripe payment charge — **v28 (session 74):** Added `CHARGEABLE_STATUSES` guard (`ready_for_delivery`, `out_for_delivery`, `delivered`) — refuses to charge orders not yet at these statuses. Also sets `billing_status='paid'` + `billed_at` + clears `charge_failed_at` on success; sets `billing_status='failed'` + `charge_failed_at` on decline. | On |
| `stripe-webhook` | Stripe webhook handler — **v34 (session 119).** Handles: `checkout.session.completed` (card save + migration credit), `payment_intent.succeeded/failed` (backup order status), `customer.subscription.created/updated/deleted` (lifecycle sync), `invoice.payment_succeeded` (recovery + clear dunning + cancel_at + recovery notification), `invoice.payment_failed` (past_due + dunning: grace period, escalating SMS+email, Stripe cancel_at), `invoice.created` (attach overage to draft renewal invoice), `customer.subscription.deleted` (final overage invoice on cancellation + clear dunning). v34: dunning flow with 7-day grace period, transactional SMS bypass, voluntary cancel protection, cancelled-status race guards. | Off |
| `send-order-notification` | Status-change notifications — **v23 (session 75):** Address fallback: when `customer.address_cache` is empty, now fetches actual address from `addresses` table via `order.pickup_address_id`. Fixes blank "Your pickup at is scheduled for..." SMS. Also added `pickup_address_id` + `delivery_address_id` to order fetch. | Off |
| `cloudprnt` | CloudPRNT server — **v15 (session 70i):** printer polls for jobs; `markupToStarLineMode()` converts Star Markup XML → Star Line Mode binary; serves as `application/vnd.star.starprnt`. Includes `tokenizeXml()` parser and `UNICODE_MAP` for thermal printer ASCII fallback. | Off |
| `optimize-route` | Google Maps route optimization. Accepts `route_id` + optional `driver_lat`/`driver_lng`. Separates done vs pending stops; only re-orders pending. Pickups and deliveries optimized independently. **v19 (session 76):** Address resolution hardened — cross-leg fallback (delivery falls back to pickup address and vice versa) + customer fallback no longer requires `is_default = true` (prefers default, accepts any). **v12 (session 27):** No-GPS path uses geographic-extremes algorithm. | Off |
| `draft-reply` | **NEW (session 80):** AI-assisted SMS reply drafting. Accepts `customer_id`, `phone`, and optional `current_draft`. **Generate mode** (no current_draft): classifies customer intent (8 categories), fetches conversation history + order context + real admin voice examples from DB, calls Claude Haiku, returns a fresh draft. **Refine mode** (current_draft provided): polishes the admin's existing text for grammar/clarity/tone while preserving all specific details. Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` Supabase secret. Never sends — admin always reviews before clicking Send. | Off |
| `stripe-terminal` | Stripe Terminal POS integration for S700 smart reader. **v5 (session 122):** Server-driven flow — no Terminal JS SDK needed. 8 actions: `connection_token`, `create_payment`, `process_payment` (pushes PI to reader via Stripe API), `check_payment_intent` (status polling), `cancel_payment`, `list_recent_payments` (last 20 card_present sales with refund status), `refund_payment` (full refund), `list_readers` (diagnostic). Uses `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` from Supabase Secrets. | Off |
| `send-receipt` | Email receipt via SendGrid. **v24 (session 121):** Added `tip_amount, tip_type` to SELECT; tip line shown between credits and total; grand total includes tip. `dedupeLineItems()` filters stale "Name: Yes" entries. | Off |
| `send-magic-link` | Branded magic-link sign-in via SendGrid. **v18 (session 123):** Added Step A refusal — refuses to call `auth.admin.generateLink()` unless a customer with `profile_id IS NOT NULL` exists for that email. Returns HTTP 200 + `{ok:false, noAccount:true, legacyCustomer?:true}` for no-customer / legacy-only emails so callers can render friendly sign-up / phone-sign-in nudges. Prevents the orphan-auth-user class of bugs entirely. Step B (self-heal) and Step C (generateLink + SendGrid) unchanged from v17. | Off |

## Admin Dashboard — Completed Features

### Orders Page
- Full order table with status pipeline filter tabs: Scheduled / In Process / Ready / Issues / **Delivered** (last 24 hours only; cancelled orders are archived, never shown)
- Click status badge to change status on individual orders
- "Advance Status" batch action (requires all selected orders to have same status)
- Cancel = hard delete (irreversible, with confirmation)
- Clickable pickup/delivery route cells for rescheduling → "Reschedule Route" modal
- "+ Assign" shown instead of "—" for unassigned reschedulable orders
- **Batch SMS:** select orders → Send SMS → compose message → sends to all customer phones
- **Order Schedule → Route Command Center (session 25):** "Order Schedule" tab now opens the Route Command Center — a chip-strip + map + draggable columns interface for managing all day's routes at once. See Routes Page notes below.
- **URL hash persistence:** browser URL updates as you navigate (e.g. `#orders/in_process`, `#orders/schedule`). Refreshing the browser restores the exact page + sub-tab you were on.

### Routes Page
- Route template editor (create/edit recurring routes)
- **Route Command Center — Order Schedule (sessions 25–26):** Replaces the old zone-pill + AM/PM Daily Schedule. Full-screen chip-strip + map + draggable columns layout:
  - **Chip strip:** One chip per route template. Click to open/close that route's column. Chips show stop count badge, time window, and dim if no run exists for the date.
  - **Draggable stop cards:** Drag a card from one column to another to reassign the stop to a different route instantly. UI updates optimistically; DB write + `autoOptimizeRoute` on both routes follows async.
  - **Cards:** 3 colors max — route color on stop-number circle, dark gray for customer name, gray for address/type/bag count.
  - **Map:** Full-width by default (empty state overlay). Shrinks as columns open. Shows colored pins + polylines for all open routes simultaneously; legend appears when 2+ routes are open. Click a card to fly-to its pin; hover highlights it.
  - **Column header:** Driver initials avatar (route color), driver name, route name, stop/pickup/delivery counts, completion progress bar.
  - **Optimize button:** Optimizes all currently open routes at once.
  - **Realtime:** Stop completions/skips/reassignments refresh the column automatically via `rccRefreshRoute`.
- Weekly Schedule: time-banded rows (morning/evening slots), one row per route, chips show driver name
- **Auto-optimization (session 24):** Routes re-optimize silently in the background whenever a stop is added (schedule picker, new order creation, drag-and-drop reassign). `autoOptimizeRoute(routeId)` fire-and-forget; refreshes open RCC column if route is active.
- **Manual Optimize button:** Optimizes all currently open RCC route columns at once (replaces old single-route Optimize).
- **Drivers > Schedule page — smart reassignment rules:** Driver chips show 🔒 (complete) or amber dot (in-progress) badges for today's column. Clicking a chip for an in-progress route shows a warning banner and reassigns only the remaining `pending`/`en_route` stops (completed stops stay attributed to the driver who did them). Clicking a chip for a complete route is a no-op with an explanatory toast. Future-week changes apply freely with no restriction.
- **Route-status badges on both schedule grids:** 🔒 (route fully complete) and amber pulsing dot (in progress) badges appear in both the Routes > Weekly Schedule grid and the Orders > Order Schedule > Driver Schedule grid for today's routes.
- **URL hash sub-tab persistence:** Maps (`#maps/routes`, `#maps/zones`), Team (`#team/permissions`), and Routes (`#routes/templates`) tabs all write to the URL hash — refresh returns you to the correct tab.

### Inbox Page
- Real SMS conversations grouped by customer
- Realtime updates (new inbound messages appear instantly)
- Reply sends via Twilio Edge Function
- "Compose" button (top right) to start a new SMS to any number
- Blue dot badge shows unread inbound count
- Customer auto-matched by last 10 digits of phone (handles any formatting)
- **✦ Draft button (session 80):** AI-assisted reply drafting sits left of the Send button. Two modes: (1) **Generate** — compose box empty → detects intent from last inbound message (8 categories: pricing, reschedule, status check, payment, complaint, cancellation, skip, new order), pulls real voice examples from `sms_messages` outbound history, fetches order context, returns a fresh draft; (2) **Refine** — compose box has text → polishes admin's draft for grammar/clarity/tone without changing meaning or specific details. Button label changes to "…refining" vs "…thinking" to signal the mode. Draft populates the textarea; admin edits and sends manually. Powered by `draft-reply` edge function + Claude Haiku. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` must be set in Supabase Secrets.

### Receipt Printing
- Browser popup print (2 copies, auto-prints on intake save + 🖨 Print button in order panel + 🖨 Reprint on kanban cards)
- **CloudPRNT automatic printing (session 22):** Star mC-Print3 prints automatically, no tap required. Admin queues a `print_jobs` row; printer polls `cloudprnt` Edge Function every few seconds and prints Star Line Mode binary. Configured via Admin → **Printer** (dedicated sidebar nav item). Falls back to browser popup when no token is set. `buildStarMarkup()` handles the full receipt layout including customer name, schedule, add-ons, invoice lines, barcode, and footer.
- **Receipt template overhaul (session 70i):** Header shows `www.familylaundry.com` (removed street address). Customer name in double-size (2:2) bold, max 12 chars. Customer address and phone shown. Pickup and delivery route names displayed in large font bold (e.g. `PU: OAKLAND AM` / `DL: OAKLAND PM`). Weight always shown (`- LBS / - BAGS` when unknown). Footer: "Questions? email info@familylaundry.com". Both print paths (order panel and kanban reprint) fetch pickup AND delivery route stops in a single query using `.in('stop_type', ['pickup', 'delivery'])`.

### Processing / Racking
- **Auto-send email receipt on Folding → Rack (session 30, commit `6068c8a`):** `saveRacking()` now fires a fire-and-forget `send-receipt` call after successfully charging the card and advancing status to `ready_for_delivery`. Previously, the receipt was only auto-sent in the POS intake flow — moving an order through the Folding → Rack kanban step charged the card silently with no email to the customer.
- **Tap-to-edit kanban cards (session 38):** Clicking/tapping any kanban card opens the edit/action panel (no more separate buttons on cards). Each step has a single context-aware action button: "Save & Start Processing" (Intake), "Save & Assign to Folder" (Cleaning), "Save & Charge → Rack" (Folding). Order details (weight, bags, add-ons, notes) are editable at every pre-charge step via `openIntakePanel(orderId, editMode)`. Shared `_buildIntakeLineItems()` helper builds line_items consistently.
- **Paid order protection (session 38):** Orders with `stripe_payment_intent_id` show a ✅ Paid badge in ALL kanban columns (Intake, Cleaning, Folding, Rack). Tapping a paid card opens the rack assignment panel directly — no edit panel. Details are read-only after charge.
- **iPad/Safari touch fix (session 38, commit `6b9ecdf`):** Refactored touch handlers with tap-vs-drag detection (10px movement threshold). `touchStartOrder()` no longer calls `event.preventDefault()` immediately, which was blocking `onclick` on iOS Safari. Taps now trigger `card.click()` on `touchEnd`; drags only initiate after sufficient finger movement.
- **Order details locked after Intake (session 39, commit `94b39e6`):** Order details (weight, bags, add-ons, notes) are now ONLY editable at the Intake column. Once pushed to Cleaning, the card shows a read-only summary. Cleaning tap → select folder → auto-advances. Folding tap → select rack → auto-charges and advances. No "next step" buttons needed — just pick and go. To re-edit, drag the card back to Intake or use the Order Details page.
- **Order Details tab — read-only/edit mode (session 39, commit `a6fa27b`):** Details tab is read-only by default with an ✏️ Edit button. Clicking Edit unlocks bags, weight, toggleable add-on chips, notes. `_opEditAddons` tracks which add-ons are on/off by index. Save recalculates totals and syncs to kanban via `reloadColumns()`. Paid orders have Edit button hidden.
- **"Processed by" folder name in summaries (session 39, commit `bce9762`):** Fold and Rack panel order summaries now show the launderer/folder name if `folded_by_id` is set.
- **Addon label fix (session 39, commit `910de48`):** `_buildIntakeLineItems()` was saving preference option labels ("Yes", "No") without the group name, creating meaningless "Yes $3.00" line items on receipts. Fixed by iterating `allPreferencesCache` to include group name (e.g. "Vinegar: Yes") and skipping $0 items. Introduced `pref_service` line_item type to distinguish preference-linked services from manually-added `addon_service` items.
- **Paid orders bypass fold panel (session 39, commit `7f96eac`):** `openFoldPanel()` now checks `stripe_payment_intent_id` — paid orders skip straight to `openRackPanel()`. Ensures paid order details (including folder name) are fully frozen.
- **Print button on all kanban panels (session 40, commit `306bd5e`):** 🖨 button added to Intake, Fold, and Rack panel headers. Calls `printBagTag(activeOrder?.id)` — works with CloudPRNT or browser popup.
- **Double-charge bug fix (session 40, commit `dae110f`):** `_buildIntakeLineItems()` was adding both a preference `price_mod` item ("Vinegar: Yes $3") AND a linked service item ("Vinegar × 1 bag $3"), doubling the charge. Now only the linked service is used when one exists. Added `_dedupeLineItems()` and `_findStaleLineItemIdxs()` helpers to filter stale "Name: Yes" entries from all display paths.
- **Billing consistency audit (session 40, commit `183807b`):** `opSaveDetails()` used type `'fee'` (should be `'delivery_fee'`) and different overage label format. Both aligned with `_buildIntakeLineItems()`. `printBagTag()` now uses `_dedupeLineItems()`. `send-receipt` edge function v21 deployed — added `pref_service` to `DISPLAY_TYPES` and `dedupeLineItems()`.
- **Folding status in STATUS_FLOW (session 40, commit `4eb54b2`):** `folding` was missing from `STATUS_FLOW`, `statusBadge`, status dropdown, and labels. Orders in folding status showed "Fully Delivered" as advance button and "Processing" as badge. Now shows purple "Folding" badge and "Advance to Ready For Delivery".
- **Outstanding balance fix (session 40, commit `4e94375`):** Customer billing panel used `billing_status` (unused column) to detect paid orders. Orders with `stripe_payment_intent_id` (actually charged) were still counted as unpaid. Fixed to filter by `stripe_payment_intent_id IS NULL`.
- **Weight prefill on Intake re-entry (session 40, commit `0f9c08e`):** When an order is dragged back to Intake from Cleaning, the weight field now prefills with the existing value instead of starting blank. Save button enables immediately if weight exists.

### Settings
- **Sidebar nav reorganized (session 23):** "Timezone" nav item renamed to **"Printer"** (printer icon) → shows only the Receipt Printer card. Business Timezone moved into **Routes → Settings tab** (new 3rd tab in the Maps/Routes page alongside Zones and Route Templates). Topbar CTA hides on the Settings tab (no action button needed there).

### New Order Modal
- **Pickup date bug fixed (session 23):** When admin picked an evening slot (e.g. 6–8pm PT on Mon Mar 16), the UTC ISO string (`2026-03-17T01:00Z`) caused `split('T')[0]` to return the next day (`2026-03-17`). This made the summary show "Tue Mar 17" and pushed the delivery calculation one day late. Fix: `selectNoDay()` now passes the local `iso` date explicitly as a 5th parameter to `selectNoSlot()`, bypassing UTC extraction entirely.

### Order Schedule (Route Command Center)
- **Phantom time band bug fixed (session 31, commit `a522084`):** The RCC column's time-window section dividers grouped stops by `pickup_window_start` for all stop types. When a delivery stop's order was originally picked up on a different route (e.g. Oakland AM at 9am), its `pickup_window_start` was the morning AM slot (16:00 UTC), which created a spurious 3rd bucket that got labeled "10–12 PM" even though Oakland PM only runs 6–10 PM. Fix: `getUtcMins()` in `rccRenderColumns()` now uses `delivery_window_start` for delivery stops and `pickup_window_start` for pickup stops. Root cause: same-day turnaround orders have pickup on one route and delivery on another — bucketing must use the stop-type-appropriate window.

### Order History (session 70d)
- **History tab in order panel:** New 4th tab (Schedule · Details · Billing · History) shows full timestamped activity timeline per order. Lazy-loads from `order_events` table with caching per order.
- **Admin attribution via `logOrderEvent()`:** 18 admin actions wired to insert events BEFORE the DB update with the logged-in admin's first name. Trigger's 3-second dedup skips when JS already logged the event — preserves "Lili" instead of "System." Covers: status changes, reschedules, weight/bags/total edits, fold/rack assignments, charge/billing, address changes, recurrence changes, batch operations.
- **SMS timestamps on Engagement page:** Message History now shows time alongside date (e.g. "Mar 25 · 2:34 pm") instead of just the date.
- **Year in date formatting (session 70e):** `fmtDate()` now includes year (e.g. "Mar 26, 2026" instead of "Mar 26"). Affects Customers page, customer profiles, SMS inbox badge, and all other admin date displays.
- **Registration time in New Customers widget (session 70f):** "Joined" column now shows date + time (e.g. "Mar 26 · 2:34 pm") instead of date only. Uses `BIZ_TZ` for Pacific time.

### Skip Attribution (session 70i)
- **`cancelled_by` now tracks the actual actor:** Admin dashboard sets `'admin'`, driver app sets `'driver'`, customer app sets `'customer'`. Previously all three hardcoded `'customer'`. Fixed in 3 locations: `opSkipOrder()`, status dropdown advance, and `setSingleOrderStatus()` in admin; driver app skip handler.
- **Skip events logged in `order_events`:** `logOrderEvent()` call added to the admin skip button so skips appear in the order History tab with admin name and timestamp.

### Issue Tracking System (session 70i)
- **`cs_issues` + `cs_issue_comments` tables:** Full issue lifecycle — create, view, comment, resolve/reopen. Issues have: customer_id, title, category, priority, status, assigned_to, notes, order_id.
- **3 entry points:** "+ New Issue" button on Overview issues panel, "⚑ Issue" button on customer profile header, and the existing inbox issue creation (now includes category and created_by).
- **Issue detail slide-over panel:** Opens from Overview issue rows. Shows meta grid (customer, priority, category, assigned to), full timeline of comments/status changes/assignment changes, and comment input box. Inline editing for assignment and priority — changes auto-logged to audit trail.
- **Categories:** pickup, delivery, billing, damaged, schedule, complaint, other.
- **Resolve/reopen:** Resolved issues disappear from Overview list; can be reopened from detail panel.

### Account Credit Billing + Paid-Order Invoice Export (session 92)
- **Account Credit** added as a payment method in the Bill Orders modal. Deducts from customer `credits` balance, marks orders `billing_status='paid'` / `billing_payment_method='credit'`, logs `credit_use` transaction.
- **isPaid check** now recognizes all payment methods: `!!o.stripe_payment_intent_id || o.billing_status === 'paid'`. Previously only Stripe payments showed as paid.
- **Paid orders are selectable** in the Completed tab for invoice export. Checkboxes enabled, "Bill Orders" button auto-hides when only paid orders are selected. "Print Invoice" always available.
- **Invoice receipts** show payment method: "✓ PAID (Account Credit)", "✓ PAID (Card)", "✓ PAID (Check)", "✓ PAID (Cash)".

### Customer Profile Orders Tab — Consolidated (session 91, commit `ab216aa`)
- Removed the **Cancelled** tab from the customer profile Orders section (not actionable for ops).
- Merged **Completed** and **Billing** into a single **Completed** tab. Clicking "Completed" now renders the billing UI directly: checkboxes, Paid/Outstanding badges, Bill Orders button, Print Invoice — no separate tab needed.
- Post-billing callbacks updated to reference `cpof-done` (the Completed button) instead of the removed `cpof-billing` element.
- Tabs are now: Scheduled · Active · Completed (3 instead of 5).

### Card Request Button Fix (session 88)
- **"Request card" / "✓ Requested" / "📞 Update card" button pipeline now works correctly.** The `_cardRequestSent` in-memory map was never populating because SMS lookup matched `'%card on file%'` (wrong) and email lookup matched a single subject that didn't exist in outbound emails. Fixed: SMS matches `'%app.familylaundry.com%'`; email uses `.or()` for all 3 known subject variants. Fixed in both Issues tab and Delivered tab lookup code.

### Reports — Subscriptions Tab (sessions 109 + 119)
- **"⭐ Subscriptions" tab** in Reports page. KPI cards: Monthly Recurring Revenue, Active Subscribers, Avg Usage (%), Churned This Month, Past Due, Paused, Overage Revenue. **4 sub-tabs (session 119):**
  - **Overview:** Subscriber detail table with name, plan, usage progress bar (color-coded: green <75%, amber 75-90%, red >90%), pickups used, status badge, signup date, and click-through to customer billing.
  - **At-Risk:** Rule-based churn signals — past_due (with dunning day count), paused (with duration), cancel pending, zero usage mid-period, very low usage vs period progress, zero pickups. Sorted by severity (high → medium → low) with color-coded badges.
  - **Upgrade Candidates:** Active subscribers near or over their plan limits — weight usage >80%, all pickups used, existing overage balance. Sorted by severity with progress bars.
  - **Usage Trends:** Chart.js bar charts (fleet-wide weight and pickups by week from `subscription_usage_log`), plus per-subscriber usage table sorted by highest usage with days-left-in-period column. Charts render lazily when tab is opened. Falls back to per-subscriber bar chart when no usage log history exists.

### POS — Stripe Terminal Integration (sessions 109 + 122)
- **Real card payment flow** via server-driven Stripe API. POS creates PaymentIntent → edge function pushes it to S700 reader → POS polls status every 2s until customer taps/inserts card → order saved with `stripe_payment_intent_id`. Reader status auto-checked on page load (online/offline indicator in topbar). No Terminal JS SDK needed — entirely server-driven via `stripe-terminal` edge function v5.
- **POS refund flow (session 122):** ↩ button in topbar opens recent card sales list (last 20 succeeded card_present payments from Stripe). Already-refunded sales shown grayed with "REFUNDED" badge. Tap a sale → confirm modal → full refund via Stripe Refunds API. Toast confirmation on success.
- **S700 reader details:** "Foothill Card Reader" (`tmr_Gd5THwTwVhTw3n`), location `tml_Gdo05A5djBbUyZ`. Reader ID hardcoded in POS as `READER_ID` constant. Single-reader shop — if a second reader is added, this needs to become a selector.
- **⚠️ Polling bug fix (session 122):** `requires_payment_method` is the normal status while the reader waits for a card. Polling must NOT treat it as a decline — only `canceled` status should abort. The Visa-worked-but-Amex-failed bug was caused by the first poll firing before the card was read and prematurely rejecting.

### Other
- Customer management, driver management, services & pricing, reports (all built)
- Driver Messages tab (in-app driver ↔ admin chat, separate from SMS)

---

## Driver App — Completed Features
- Daily route loads automatically by driver login
- Per-stop detail view: address, customer name, order info, special instructions
- One-tap Google Maps navigation
- Mark pickup / delivery complete with required photo
- **Capture-now-upload-later photo queue (session 70e):** Photos are compressed (1200px max, 80% JPEG — typically 4MB→400KB) and stored locally via IndexedDB. Complete button unlocks immediately after capture — no waiting for upload. Background queue uploads to Supabase Storage with automatic retry every 30s + instant retry on `online` event. Amber badge on Route nav shows pending upload count. Queue persists across app restarts via IndexedDB.
- **📲 On My Way button** → marks stop `en_route` + sends customer an SMS automatically
- Undo complete (within same session)
- **"Can't Complete" unified stop action (session 88, commit `7decbd3`):** Replaced the two confusing buttons ("Skip This Stop" + "Failed Pickup") with a single "Can't Complete" button. Shows a reason picker bottom sheet with 5 options: Bags not out, Can't access, Customer not home, Customer requested skip, Other. All driver-initiated incompletes now set order status to `pickup_failed` with `cancelled_by: 'driver'` and the reason stored in `orders.driver_skip_reason`. Route stop status uses `skipped`. Customer gets `pickup_failed` SMS notification. 12-second undo window fully restores status, notes, and reason. Admin Issues tab badge shows the reason (e.g. "Can't Complete (Bags not out)"). Customer/admin-initiated skips still use `skipped` status — only driver flow changed.
- **Realtime stop reassignment:** If admin reassigns a stop to another driver while they're en route, the stop disappears from the original driver's app with a toast. If a stop is newly assigned to a driver, their app triggers a reload to pick it up. Handles `driver_id = NULL` stops correctly (stop appears/disappears based on route ownership, not just explicit driver_id match).
- **Live GPS always current (session 24):** `_driverLat`/`_driverLng` module-level variables updated on every `watchPosition` fix — not throttled like the DB write. Always reflect the driver's actual current position for re-optimization.
- **Dynamic route re-optimization (session 24):** After marking any stop complete, failed, or skipped, `reoptimizeRoute(routeId)` fires automatically (non-blocking). Sends driver GPS to `optimize-route` edge function; re-orders pending stops from where the driver actually is; re-sorts `allStops` and re-renders the home screen. Silent fail — driver experience unaffected if optimization fails.
- **Phone OTP login (session 21):** Magic Link tab replaced with Phone Code tab. Two-step flow: enter phone → enter SMS code. E.164 normalisation handles 10-digit US numbers automatically. `link_phone_auth_driver` RPC re-points existing driver records to the new phone-auth UUID on first login — drivers don't lose their history. Requires drivers to have a phone number stored in their profile.
- **Later Today strip (session 29):** Upcoming routes (window > 2h away) shown as a collapsed strip at the bottom of the home screen rather than a full route card. Prevents drivers from seeing and acting on routes that aren't relevant yet. Tapping expands to preview route names and start times.
- **Stop detail — En Route stage (session 29):** Tapping "I'm On My Way" now keeps the driver on Phase 1 (showing a green "Customer notified" chip + Maps button + big green "I've Arrived" CTA). Previously jumped directly to bags/notes. Driver must tap "I've Arrived" to advance to the at-stop flow. Handles page reloads correctly — `en_route` status shows the en-route state, not bags.
- **Stop detail — Back button (session 29):** Photo screen (sub-phase 2) now has a "← Back" button that returns to bags/notes (sub-phase 1) so drivers can correct bag count or notes before completing.
- **Stop detail — Text Customer button (session 29):** "💬 Text Customer" SMS link shown in the customer section on all active stops with a phone on file. Opens the driver's native SMS app pre-filled with the customer's number.
- **Driver app design overhaul — "Jony Ive" pass (session 30, commit `a9b04a7`):** Full visual redesign. Unified all action blues to `var(--accent)` (removed 6 hardcoded `#1a73e8` instances). Simplified to 3 button levels: primary filled, skip/fail outlined, back/sms text links. Removed decorative noise: arrival chip, emoji, hint text, order# and service name rows from stop detail. Stop cards hide PICKUP/DELIVERY type badge for pending stops (only show status badges: Done/Skipped/Failed/En Route). Phone + SMS collapsed to one row in customer section. Phase 2 button order: Complete → Back (text link) → hairline separator → Skip → Fail. En-route chip changed from green to neutral gray. Dead `.btn-fail-stop` CSS removed.
- **Stop type pills always visible (session 31, commit `a522084`):** Every stop card now shows a permanent 🧺 Pickup or 📦 Delivery pill badge (using existing `sb-pickup`/`sb-delivery` CSS classes). Status badges (Done/Skipped/etc.) appear alongside when applicable. Previously, type was only implied by the circle color — unclear for drivers scanning a list quickly.
- **Full time window display (session 31):** Route header subtitle shows "1 pickup · 1 delivery" breakdown in planning view (was "2 stops · not started yet"). Home screen peek cards and planning view banner now show the full window range e.g. "6:00 PM – 8:00 PM" (was "Starts at 6:00 PM"). Uses new `fmtWindowRange(tmpl)` helper.
- **Rack Check pre-departure checklist (session 31):** In the planning view (before the route window opens), a 📋 Bag Check section appears above the stop list for all delivery stops. Driver taps "✓ On Rack" or "Missing" for each bag. Progress counter updates live; all-green shows a "ready to go" banner; any missing bags show a red "contact dispatch" warning. State persists to `localStorage` keyed by route+date so it survives a page reload. Scroll position preserved across re-renders so tapping a check button doesn't jump to the top of the list. Note: rack check is currently in the planning view only (visible 2h before route opens). Future: add `rack_checked_at` to `route_stops` for admin visibility.

---

## Customer App — Completed Features
- Full order booking flow: address lookup, pickup/delivery date & window selection, bag count, preferences, confirmation
- Same-day delivery toggle for AM routes (Berkeley AM, Oakland AM) — +$10 surcharge, PM delivery window locked automatically
- **Route-template turnaround enforcement (session 19):** Delivery windows are filtered by the pickup route template's `window_start` time. A PM pickup (template start ≥ 6pm) cannot show AM delivery slots on the next morning. `templateStartMins` added to window objects; `draft._earliestDeliveryWindowMins` tracks the floor. Three guard layers: window render filter, auto-select on date change, and final check in `placeOrder()`.
- **Sign-out button reset (session 19):** `loadAccount()` now resets the Sign Out button to its default state on every visit — prevents it staying stuck in "Signing out…" after a sign-in/sign-out cycle in the same browser session.
- Account management: name, email, password change, address book, laundry preferences, recurring plan, order history
- Customer-initiated skip button on recurring orders (pre-pickup only)
- Referral source captured at signup
- **Phone number required at signup (session 70f):** All three registration paths (email sign-up form, in-checkout sign-up, OTP name panel) now enforce phone number with JS-level 10-digit validation. Prevents accounts with no phone — critical for SMS delivery updates and driver contact.
- **Phone OTP login (session 20/21):** SMS code login via Twilio. `link_phone_auth_account` RPC (SECURITY DEFINER) re-points existing customer records to the new phone-auth UUID on first login — customers with existing email accounts don't lose their history. Multiple-account collision handled with a graceful error + auto sign-out.
- **Capacity-aware booking UX (session 69, commits `3ac0b59`, `53ce21d`):** When routes are full, the booking screen now shows a red "Full" badge and disables that time slot. Almost-full slots (≤5 spots left) show an amber badge like "3 spots left". When ALL slots on a day are full, a yellow nudge banner says "Please pick a different day for faster service." Auto-select logic skips full windows. Works for both pickup and delivery date selection.
- **Per-sub-window capacity enforcement (session 69):** Capacity is now checked per sub-window (e.g. 6–8 PM and 8–10 PM separately) rather than for the whole route template. A route with `stop_limit = 30` and 2 sub-windows gets 15 per sub-window. Both the DB function `auto_route_order()` and the customer app booking flow enforce this. Prevents lopsided booking (e.g. 29 stops in one sub-window, 1 in the other).
- **Default tip setting in customer app (session 70i):** Customers can now set their own default tip in Account → Payment Method. $/% toggle and numeric input, saves to `default_tip` and `default_tip_type` on the `customers` table — same fields the admin dashboard reads. Tip is auto-applied to each new order.
- **OTP progressive fallback flow (session 73):** When SMS OTP doesn't arrive, fallback options reveal progressively: "Resend code" appears after 15 seconds, email magic-link fallback after 30 seconds. Email fallback uses the existing `send-magic-link` edge function — customer enters email, gets a one-tap sign-in link. "Need help? Text HELP to (510) 588-4102" support shortcut shown on both the hero (phone entry) and OTP verify screens. Timers reset/clear on panel transitions. No dead-end screens — every state has an escape route.
- **Cross-method auth re-linking (session 30, commit `778e9d8`):** `ensureProfile()` step 2b — if a customer signs in via email magic link but their account was originally created via phone OTP (or vice versa), the function now detects the existing customer record by `email_cache` even if it already has a `profile_id`, and re-points it to the current auth user. Previously, this created a blank duplicate customer record. Two orphaned records from the first occurrence were deleted from the DB. Note: Supabase creates a new auth UUID per sign-in method; `profile_id` flips to whichever method was used most recently — harmless in practice.
- **Past-due dunning banner (session 119):** When subscription status is `past_due`, a red banner appears on the home screen subscription card: "Payment failed — Please update your card to keep your subscription active." Includes "Update Payment Method" button that navigates to Account → My Plan. Auto-hides when status recovers.
- **Subscription home card + My Plan panel (session 109, Phase 1 UI only):** Home screen shows a subscription usage card (plan name, weight used/limit progress bar, pickups used, renewal date, Manage button) — but ONLY when the customer has an active subscription (`_activeSub` global). Default: completely hidden. My Plan menu item in Account is also hidden by default; shown via JS toggle when `_activeSub` is non-null. My Plan panel has dual-mode: subscribers see usage stats, billing period, overage info, and pause/resume/cancel buttons (stubs — "coming soon" toast); non-subscribers see plan picker cards. `renderHomeSubscriptionCard()` fetches from `subscriptions` joined with `subscription_plans` on every `loadHome()`. `loadAccount()` fetches subscription and updates plan badge (Active/Paused/Past Due with colored dots).

---

## Subscription Feature — Phase 1 Foundation (session 109)

**Plan:** $260/month, up to 100 lbs Wash & Fold, 4 free pickup/deliveries, $2.75/lb overage. Add-ons extra. Recurring billing anchored to signup day. Pausable anytime.

**Billing rules:**
- First month billed on signup day
- Overages billed immediately (not end of term) — customer receives email receipt
- Stripe handles 31st-of-month edge cases automatically (bills on last day of shorter months)

**Database (migration `subscription_phase1_foundation` — applied):**
- `subscription_plans` extended: `weight_limit_lbs` (100), `overage_price_per_lb` ($2.75), `delivery_limit` (4), `includes_addons` (false)
- `subscriptions` extended: `usage_lbs_this_period`, `pickups_this_period`, `overage_amount_due`, `signup_date`, `paused_at`, `cancelled_at`, `cancel_at_period_end`
- New table `subscription_usage_log`: audit trail for weight/pickup usage events per subscription per order. RLS enabled + indexes.
- Old plans (Pay As You Go, Standard, Premium) deactivated. New plan: "Wash & Fold Monthly" ($260, 100 lbs, 4 pickups, no add-ons included).

**What's built (Phase 1):** DB foundation, admin Subscriptions report tab, customer app subscription UI (hidden until active). All UI-only — no Stripe subscription integration yet.

**Completed phases:**
- Phase 1: DB foundation + admin report tab + customer app UI (session 109)
- Phase 2: Stripe lifecycle — `pause-subscription`, `resume-subscription`, `cancel-subscription` edge functions, `stripe-webhook` v29 with subscription event handlers, customer-app pause/resume/cancel buttons wired live (session 111)
- Phase 3: Order flow + usage tracking — `apply_subscription_usage_fn` trigger deducts weight on delivery, logs to `subscription_usage_log`, marks order `billing_status='paid'` + `billing_payment_method='subscription'` (session 114)
- Phase 4: Overage auto-billing — `stripe-webhook` v30 attaches `overage_amount_due` as invoice_item on draft renewal invoice (session 115)
- Phase 5: Auto-pickup — post-checkout day/window picker, first recurring order auto-created with `subscription_id`, manual orders linked to active subscription, `charge-order` v36 subscription guard (session 118)

- Phase 6: Mid-cycle cancellation overage — `stripe-webhook` v32 creates standalone invoice on `customer.subscription.deleted`, with race-condition guards and idempotency (session 118)
- Phase 7: Failed payment recovery — `stripe-webhook` v34 dunning flow: 7-day grace period via Stripe `cancel_at`, escalating SMS+email notifications (initial/reminder/final/recovered), `dunning_started_at` tracking, customer app past_due banner. QA: transactional SMS bypass, voluntary cancel protection, cancelled-status race guards (session 119)
- Phase 8: Analytics — Reports > Subscriptions enhanced with 4 sub-tabs: Overview, At-Risk (rule-based churn signals), Upgrade Candidates (near-limit detection), Usage Trends (Chart.js fleet charts + per-subscriber table). Also cleaned up duplicate HTML (session 119)

**Post-phase bug fix (session 120):** `subscriptions_status_check` constraint expanded to include all Stripe statuses (`incomplete`, `incomplete_expired`, `trialing`, `unpaid`). The original constraint silently rejected `customer.subscription.created` events. `SUBSCRIPTIONS_ENABLED = false` feature flag added to `customer-app/index.html` (~line 1679) gating 8 touchpoints — flip to `true` when ready to launch subscriptions to real customers.

**All subscription phases complete. Subscriptions are feature-flagged OFF in customer app until launch.**

## Design Principles

These are standing decisions that guide how features are built. When in doubt, defer to these.

| Principle | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Automation over manual input** | Every time data needs to stay in sync across two places, use a DB trigger, RLS policy, or Edge Function — never require the admin to take an extra step. If adding a feature creates a new place where data could go stale, automate the sync before shipping. |
| **`driver_id` is the source of truth for route assignment** | `pickup_driver_id` / `delivery_driver_id` are legacy fields. App code always reads `driver_id`. RLS policies check both, but the trigger `trg_sync_route_driver` keeps the legacy fields cleared automatically. |
| **`driver_id = NULL` on stops means inherit from route** | Stops get `NULL` by default; explicit UUIDs are overrides only. All queries and RLS policies must handle both cases — never assume a non-null driver_id. |
| **Single-file SPAs, no build step** | All three apps are pure HTML/CSS/JS in one file. No npm, no bundler, no framework. Keep it that way. |
| **Time windows are client-side** | Route visibility (`isRouteVisible`, `isUpcomingRoute`) is computed in the browser using the device's local time. `window_start`/`window_end` in the DB are naive times (no timezone) interpreted as the driver's local timezone. |
| **Routes stay open until window_end + 2hr buffer** | Orders can be added throughout the day, even during an active route. The schedule view must not lock a route just because all *current* stops are resolved — new stops may still arrive. A route only locks after the time window ends plus a 2-hour buffer. This applies to both the schedule grid chips and the driver reassignment popover. |

---

## Terminology

We use **"Route"** for everything — both the template definition (e.g. "the Oakland AM route") and a specific dated instance (e.g. "the Oakland AM route on March 12"). We never say "run" in conversation or UI. The DB still has legacy column names like `run_date`, `pickup_run_id`, `delivery_run_id` — renaming those would touch hundreds of lines across all apps, so they stay as-is, but in all human-facing text and notes we say "route."

---

## Database Key Tables

| Table | Notes |
|---|---|
| `customers` | `phone_cache` stores phone in any format (e.g. `(415) 608-5446`). **`pricelist`** (session 97p3, Apr 8 2026): replaces the old `customer_type` column. NOT NULL, default `'Delivery'`, CHECK constraint `pricelist IN ('Delivery', 'Commercial')`. Every customer belongs to exactly ONE price list — assigned manually by admin, never derived from customer self-selection. A Commercial customer gets Commercial pricing everywhere (admin intake, customer app, recurring orders, new orders). During the migration window, `customer_type` still exists as a legacy column kept in perfect sync with `pricelist` via the `trg_sync_customer_type_pricelist` BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE trigger — this lets old cached clients and the new code coexist. Migration 2 will drop `customer_type` + the sync trigger once we've confirmed nothing still reads the old column. |
| `orders` | Status pipeline: scheduled → picked_up → processing → ready_for_delivery → out_for_delivery → delivered. (`ready_for_pickup` was removed session 6 — never auto-set, redundant.) `source`: scheduled, walk_in, customer_app, recurring. `cancelled_by`: 'customer', 'driver', 'admin', 'system' (nullable) — set on skip/cancel to distinguish who initiated. **Session 70i fix:** admin dashboard now sets `'admin'`, driver app sets `'driver'`, customer app sets `'customer'` (was all hardcoded to `'customer'`). Skip events also logged in `order_events`. `charge_failed_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ, session 70h): set by charge-order v26 on decline; compared against `customer_payment_methods.created_at` to detect stale cards |
| `route_templates` | Recurring route definitions: zone, schedule_days (0=Mon..5=Sat), window_start/end, turnaround_days, default drivers, stop_limit |
| `routes` | Dated route instances (auto-created from templates by `auto_route_order()`). Links to template_id, date, single `driver_id`. `pickup_driver_id`/`delivery_driver_id` columns exist but are not used by app code — auto-cleared by `trg_sync_route_driver` whenever `driver_id` changes, keeping RLS policies consistent |
| `route_stops` | Stops may have `driver_id = NULL` (inherits from parent route's `driver_id`) or an explicit UUID override. `trg_fill_stop_driver` auto-fills on INSERT. RLS policies handle both cases |
| `route_driver_schedule` | Per-day driver assignments: (template_id, day_of_week, driver_type) → driver_id. Sole source of truth for driver scheduling (no template defaults) |
| `driver_locations` | Live GPS: one row per driver (UPSERT on driver_id), updated every 12s from driver app. Realtime-enabled |
| `order_events` | **NEW (session 70d)** Audit log for every order action. Columns: `order_id`, `event_type`, `description`, `old_value`, `new_value`, `actor_id`, `actor_name`, `created_at`. 3-second dedup between JS-inserted events (with admin name) and trigger-inserted events (with 'System'). ~4,900 events backfilled. |
| `sms_messages` | All SMS in/out. `direction`: inbound/outbound. Linked to `customers` by phone matching |
| `driver_messages` | In-app admin ↔ driver chat (not SMS) |

### Key DB Functions & Triggers
| Object | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `auto_route_order(p_order_id)` | Function | Matches order to template by zone+day+time, finds/creates the dated route, assigns driver, creates stops. Sets `routing_error` on orders if no match found. **Session 71: dedup guards.** **Session 122: sub-window snapping** — after creating pickup/delivery stops, snaps order windows to nearest valid sub-window boundary (based on template `arrival_window_hours`). Fixes misalignment where windows fell inside the template range but not on a sub-window edge. Both pickup AND delivery sides now snap. Migration: `snap_windows_to_subwindow_boundaries`. |
| `trg_auto_route_new_order` | Trigger (AFTER INSERT on orders) | Fires for all new scheduled orders — sets routing_error for missing zone, calls auto_route_order for valid orders |
| `trg_create_recurring_order` | Trigger (AFTER UPDATE on orders) | On status → `delivered` OR `skipped` (when `cancelled_by = 'customer'`) with recurring_interval, creates next order. Bumps both pickup AND delivery off Sundays to Monday. **Session 71: dedup check added** — before inserting, checks if customer already has a `scheduled` order on the same pickup date (Pacific time). If so, skips the insert silently. Prevents duplicates when customer manually books via the app before the recurring trigger fires. |
| `trg_sync_order_status` | Trigger (AFTER UPDATE on route_stops) | When all pickup stops → complete, order → `picked_up`. When all delivery stops → complete, order → `delivered` |
| `trg_fill_stop_driver` | Trigger (BEFORE INSERT on route_stops) | Auto-fills `driver_id` from parent route when stop is inserted with NULL driver |
| `trg_cascade_route_driver` | Trigger (AFTER UPDATE OF driver_id ON routes) | When admin reassigns driver on a route, cascades to all pending/en_route stops |
| `trg_sync_customer_cache` | Trigger (AFTER UPDATE on profiles) | Syncs `first_name`/`last_name` changes to `customers.first_name_cache`/`last_name_cache` |
| `auto_fail_expired_orders()` | Function (pg_cron every 30min) | Fails **`scheduled`** orders 2h past their window (session 6: no longer targets `ready_for_pickup`), sends SMS, stamps `cancelled_by = 'system'` |
| `trg_sync_stops_on_order_terminal` | Trigger (AFTER UPDATE on orders) | When order reaches terminal status, cascades to route_stops: delivered→complete, cancelled→skipped, pickup_failed→failed+skipped, skipped→skipped |
| `trg_route_stops_updated_at` | Trigger (BEFORE UPDATE on route_stops) | Auto-sets `updated_at = now()` on every route_stop write |
| `trg_sync_route_driver` | Trigger (BEFORE UPDATE OF driver_id ON routes) | When a route's primary driver changes, auto-clears `pickup_driver_id`/`delivery_driver_id` to NULL. Ensures RLS policies always derive driver access from `driver_id` — no manual cleanup needed when reassigning via the schedule |
| `find_customer_by_phone(digits)` | Function | Matches phone by last 10 digits |
| `log_order_change()` | Trigger (AFTER UPDATE on orders) | **NEW (session 70d)** Comprehensive audit trigger. Logs: status changes, weight/bags/total changes, folded_by (with folder name from profiles), racked, pickup/delivery route assignments, billing status, pickup/delivery rescheduling. 3-second dedup on all sections — if JS already inserted the event, trigger skips. FK on `actor_id` was dropped (launderers not in profiles table). |
| `log_order_created()` | Trigger (AFTER INSERT on orders) | **NEW (session 70d)** Logs "Order created" with actor = Customer/System based on source |

---

## Phone Number Matching
Twilio sends E.164 (`+14156085446`), DB stores formatted (`(415) 608-5446`).
We match by stripping all non-digits and comparing last 10 digits.
Postgres function: `find_customer_by_phone(digits TEXT)`.

---

## SMS Automation — Status

### SMS Template Status (updated session 126)

**14 of 16 templates are `sms_enabled = true`.** Operational SMS (delivery + walk-in) is fully live. Only marketing templates remain off.

**Enabled — delivery fleet (12):** `customer_registered`, `order_confirmed`, `driver_on_way_pickup`, `order_picked_up`, `driver_on_way_delivery`, `order_delivered`, `payment_received`, `payment_failed`, `pickup_reminder_recurring`, `pickup_day_reminder`, `skip_confirmation`, `pickup_failed`

**Enabled — walk-in retail (2, added session 126):** `walkin_order_placed`, `walkin_order_ready`. Both fire client-side from the POS (`pos/index.html` → `sendPosTemplateSms`), not from triggers or cron. Placeholders: `{{first_name}}`, `{{order_number}}`. Kill switch: flip `sms_enabled = false` in the admin dashboard's Notifications editor.

**Still disabled (2):** `review_request`, `reorder_reminder` — both marketing. Re-enable when ready.

**Still removed (not re-created):**
- DB triggers `trg_customer_registered_insert` and `trg_customer_phone_first_set` — dropped in session 41
- Claude AI in `twilio-webhook` — permanently removed (v27)

**Restored (session 59):**
- pg_cron jobs `wr-reminder-evening` and `wr-reminder-morning` — re-created with proper schedules and HTTP POST payloads calling `send-scheduled-reminders` edge function (v15). Evening runs at 8 PM PT, morning at 7 AM PT.

**What works:**
- `twilio-webhook` v27 handles inbound keywords: STOP, START, SKIP, PICKUP, HELP
- STOP clears `sms_consent_at` in the DB. Twilio also blocks at carrier level.
- START re-sets `sms_consent_at`
- All other inbound messages route silently to human inbox (no auto-reply)
- 1,042 customers have opted out of SMS (`sms_consent_at = NULL`) as of session 56

### ✅ Phase 1 — Keywords Only (twilio-webhook v27, session 41)

**Keyword actions (deterministic):**
- `STOP` — Clears `sms_consent_at` in DB, confirms opt-out. Twilio also blocks at carrier level.
- `START` / `UNSTOP` — Re-sets `sms_consent_at`, confirms re-subscription.
- `PICKUP` — Books next evening pickup using last order as template (zone, address, bags). Blocks if active order already exists. Falls back to default address + zone lookup for new customers.
- `SKIP` — Skips next scheduled order, fires `skip_confirmation` template.
- `HELP` — Returns menu of available commands (PICKUP, SKIP, STOP, START).

**Claude AI — REMOVED (session 41).** Was live in v22–v26. Removed because the feature was deployed prematurely during the customer import session. All non-keyword messages now route to the human inbox with no auto-reply. Claude AI SMS may be revisited in a future session with proper planning and David's explicit approval.

### Phase 2 — Pending (deprioritized)
- Claude AI natural-language replies — revisit when David is ready
- Natural-language cancellations: "Can I cancel Thursday?" — needs `conversations` table
- New bookings via SMS: "Book a pickup tonight"

## Stripe Migration (Starchup → Family Laundry)

When ready to cut over from Starchup, customer payment methods need to be migrated between Stripe accounts.

| | Account ID |
|---|---|
| **Source** (Starchup connected account, current) | `acct_1PJhUs2f1JPZhPdh` |
| **Destination** (Family Laundry standalone account) | `acct_1MPrRDGACgbvEugH` |

### Migration process
1. Pull the list of `cus_xxx` Stripe customer IDs from Starchup's export
2. Open a support ticket with Stripe requesting payment method migration between the two accounts — include both account IDs and the customer ID list
3. Stripe manually migrates card tokens (typically 1–3 weeks)
4. Once migrated, import customers into WashRoute DB with the new `cus_xxx` IDs

### Fallback plan
If migration is incomplete or Stripe can't move certain cards, run a re-entry email campaign asking customers to re-add their card (small incentive helps conversion).

---

## Recurring Order Auto-Scheduling

### How it works (two mechanisms)

**1. Trigger-based (primary, real-time):** When an order with `recurring_interval` is marked `delivered`, the `trg_create_recurring_order` trigger immediately creates the next order with shifted pickup/delivery windows (weekly +7d, biweekly +14d, monthly +1mo). Sundays are skipped (bumped to Monday). The new order INSERT fires `trg_auto_route_new_order` which auto-assigns it to the correct route. Source is set to `'recurring'`.

**2. pg_cron batch (backup, daily):** A Postgres function `create_recurring_orders()` runs every day at **8 AM UTC** (midnight Pacific) via pg_cron. For each customer's most recent recurring order, it calculates the next pickup date and creates orders within a 7-day lookahead window. Idempotent — won't create duplicates.

**Manual trigger:** Admin Dashboard → Overview → "Recurring Orders" panel → **▶ Run Scheduler** button.

**To view the cron schedule:** Supabase Dashboard → Database → Cron Jobs → `create-recurring-orders`.

---

## Known Recurring Issues

### 🔄 Login button gets permanently stuck ("Signing in…")
**Symptom:** After tapping Sign In, the button stays disabled and says "Signing in…" forever. Sometimes called a "cache issue" but it's actually a network hang.

**Root cause:** `db.auth.signInWithPassword()` can silently hang on flaky/mobile networks — the Promise never settles, so `try/catch` can't save you and the button stays stuck.

**Why `Promise.race` does NOT fix this:** The Supabase auth client doesn't behave as a plain Promise in a `Promise.race` — the timeout leg fires immediately, causing instant "Connection timed out" errors on every login.

**Current fix — two-stage safety net (all three apps):**

There are actually **two separate hang points** that must both be covered:

1. **`signInWithPassword` itself hangs** → `safetyTimer` (30s) in `handleLogin()` / `doLogin()` covers this. `clearTimeout(safetyTimer)` is called in all resolution paths.

2. **Post-auth DB fetch hangs** → After `signInWithPassword` resolves, `onAuthStateChange` fires and immediately does a DB query (profile fetch in admin, `loadDriverData()` in driver app). If that fetch hangs, the first safety timer is already cleared and nothing resets the button. Fixed with a second `profileTimer` / `loadTimer` (15s) scoped inside `onAuthStateChange`.

**Customer app is safe** — `showLoading()` has a built-in 20s self-dismiss timer, and the login button is explicitly re-enabled on `signInWithPassword` success before `onAuthStateChange` fires.

**If it recurs:** Check both `handleLogin()` (for the 30s `safetyTimer`) **and** `onAuthStateChange` (for the 15s `profileTimer`/`loadTimer`) in whichever app is stuck.

---

## 📋 Working Convention

**Update PROJECT-NOTES.md at the end of every session.** This is the only memory that persists between days — Claude starts fresh each session, so anything not written here is lost. At end of day, log what was built, any decisions made, and anything pending.

**Update the Git Log section after every major commit or deploy.** Keep it current so future sessions can see the full history at a glance.

---

## ✅ Skip Behavior — Design Decision (sessions 5, 56)

`cancelled_by` column is fully implemented across DB, all three apps, and all skip/cancel paths.

**Core rule (updated session 56):** A skip is always routine — regardless of who initiates it (customer, driver, or admin). Skips keep the recurring subscription alive and stay out of the Issues tab. Only cancels, pickup failures, and delivery failures are real problems.

| Who acted | Action | `cancelled_by` value | Appears in Issues? | Next recurring order? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Customer | Skip | `'customer'` | ❌ No | ✅ Yes — chain continues |
| Driver | Skip | `'customer'` | ❌ No | ✅ Yes — chain continues |
| Admin | Skip | `'customer'` | ❌ No | ✅ Yes — chain continues |
| Driver | Fail pickup | `'driver'` | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Admin | Cancel / Fail | `'admin'` | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Auto-fail cron | Expire | `'system'` | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |

### Entry points
- **Customer app:** "Skip this pickup" button on order detail. Sets `status = 'skipped', cancelled_by = 'customer'`.
- **Driver app:** `skipStop()` sets `cancelled_by = 'driver'`.
- **Admin:** `opSkipOrder()`, `opSetOrderStatus()`, and `setSingleOrderStatus()` set `cancelled_by = 'admin'` for skips.
- **SMS automation:** SKIP keyword in `twilio-webhook` sets `cancelled_by = 'customer'`.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL — Recurring order chain rule
**`trg_create_recurring_order_fn` fires on ANY skip, regardless of `cancelled_by`.** A "skip" means "skip this one occurrence" — the subscription ALWAYS continues. The `cancelled_by` field is for attribution only (who did it), NOT for controlling whether the chain continues.

**History of this bug (do not repeat):** Session 56 made all skips set `cancelled_by = 'customer'` to keep the chain going. Session 70i changed it to actual-actor ('admin'/'driver') for attribution — but forgot to update the trigger, which still checked `cancelled_by = 'customer'`. This silently broke recurring chains for admin/driver skips. Fixed session 73 by removing the `cancelled_by` condition from the trigger entirely.

### Key behavior
- Issues tab excludes: (1) orders where `cancelled_by = 'customer'` AND status = 'skipped', (2) skipped recurring orders (any actor — they auto-create next occurrence), (3) recurring `pickup_failed` orders (same reason).
- `billing_status = 'failed'` orders always surface in Issues regardless of `cancelled_by`.
- `billing_status` values: `'paid'` (charged successfully), `'failed'` (card declined), `'refunded'`, or `null` (not yet charged). Set by `charge-order` v25 and `stripe-webhook` v24.
- `billed_at` timestamp: set when Stripe charge succeeds. Used by Revenue Today stat card to show same-day revenue in Pacific time.

## Known Issues (found, not yet fixed)

| # | Severity | Where | Symptom |
|---|----------|-------|---------|
| 1 | ~~P2 → Fixed~~ | `route_stops` | ~~Stops stay `pending` when order reaches `delivered` or `pickup_failed` via admin~~ — **FIXED session 3**: DB trigger `trg_sync_stops_on_order_terminal` now cascades order terminal status to route_stops. Backfill ran on all existing orphaned stops. |
| 2 | ~~P2 → Fixed~~ | `route_stops` | ~~Cancelled orders retain their pending route stops~~ — **FIXED session 3**: Same trigger handles `cancelled` → stops set to `skipped`. Hard deletes handled by existing FK CASCADE DELETE. |
| 3 | ~~P2 → Fixed~~ | admin `saveOrder()` | ~~Admin-created orders always saved with `total_amount = 0`~~ — **FIXED session 35**: `saveOrder()` now includes `service_id`, `total_bags`, `total_amount`, and `line_items`. Service always defaults to Wash & Fold Delivery ($59/bag). |
| 4 | P2 Medium | `confirmReassignDriver` | ~~Order Schedule map/list stays stale after reassignment — **FIXED commit 7916331**~~ |
| 5 | P3 Low → Likely non-issue | processing kanban | Price recalculated at rack step doesn't match original order total — order #84 stored $164.95 but processing showed/saved $139.95. **Investigated session 3:** `saveIntake()` correctly writes `bd.total` from `calcProcTotal()`. `saveRacking()` does NOT update `total_amount`. Discrepancy on order #84 was a legacy/pre-existing test value — not a code bug. Monitor real orders to confirm. |
| 6 | ~~P3 → Fixed~~ | `route_stops` DB | ~~`updated_at` column not refreshed on driver reassignment or status changes~~ — **FIXED session 4**: DB trigger `trg_route_stops_updated_at` (BEFORE UPDATE) now auto-sets `updated_at = now()` on every write. Migration `route_stops_auto_updated_at` applied. |
| 7 | P0 → Fixed | driver app realtime handler | ~~Stops reassigned to another driver stayed in original driver's list — **FIXED commit 7916331**~~ |
| 8 | ~~P3 → Fixed~~ | driver app "skip notification" | ~~Banner read "Customer notified · Safe travels!" even when no SMS was sent~~ — **FIXED commit 0930719**: `notified` flag now checks only `stop.on_my_way_sent_at`, not `isEnRoute`. Banner correctly shows "Arrived at stop" when driver skipped notification. |
| 9 | ~~P0 → Fixed~~ | `send-sms`, `notify-on-my-way` edge functions | ~~Hardcoded Twilio auth token as `\|\| 'cdfc2502...'` fallback~~ — **FIXED session 8**: Token rotated in Twilio. Both functions redeployed reading from Supabase Secrets only. `create-test-user` unauthenticated endpoint also neutralized (returns 404). |
| 10 | ~~P0 → Fixed~~ | RLS — `customer_payment_methods` | ~~Policy `cpm_anon_all` grants ALL to anon.~~ **FIXED session 21b** (migration `rls_security_hardening`): `cpm_anon_all` dropped. Only `cpm_auth_all` (authenticated) remains. |
| 11 | ~~P0 → Fixed~~ | RLS — `sms_messages` | ~~`anon_all_sms_messages` exposes all SMS conversations to anyone.~~ **FIXED session 21b**: Policy dropped. Only `admin_all_sms_messages` (is_admin()) remains. Edge functions use service role. |
| 12 | ~~P1 → Fixed~~ | RLS — `customers` | ~~`anon_write_customers` + `Admin anon read customers` — unauthenticated read/write of all customer PII.~~ **FIXED session 21b**: Both dropped. Scoped per-customer + admin policies remain. |
| 13 | ~~P1 → Fixed~~ | RLS — `orders` | ~~`anon_write_orders` + `Admin anon read orders`.~~ **FIXED session 21b**: Both dropped. Scoped per-customer, per-driver, and admin policies remain. |
| 14 | ~~P1 → Fixed~~ | RLS — `discounts` | ~~`anon_all_discounts` — anyone could create or delete discount codes.~~ **FIXED session 21b**: Replaced with `anon_read_discounts` (SELECT only). `admin_all_discounts` handles writes. |
| 15 | ~~P1 → Fixed~~ | RLS — `settings` | ~~`anon_all_settings` — anyone could modify business config.~~ **FIXED session 21b**: Replaced with `anon_read_settings` (SELECT only). `admin_all_settings` handles writes. |
| 16 | ~~P2 → Fixed~~ | RLS — `driver_locations` | ~~Anyone could spoof driver GPS coordinates.~~ **FIXED session 21b**: Replaced with `authenticated_read_driver_locations` (SELECT) + `driver_insert_own_location` + `driver_update_own_location` (scoped to own driver_id). |
| 17 | ~~P2 → Fixed~~ | RLS — `message_templates` | ~~`anon_all_message_templates` — anyone could edit SMS templates.~~ **FIXED session 21b**: Dropped. `admin_all_message_templates` + edge functions (service role) cover all access. |
| 18 | ~~P2 → Fixed~~ | RLS — `route_driver_overrides` | ~~`Allow all access` with no conditions.~~ **FIXED session 21b**: Replaced with `admin_all_route_driver_overrides` + `auth_read_route_driver_overrides`. |
| 19 | ~~P2 → Fixed~~ | Google Maps API key | ~~Key `AIzaSyDfIiB3LFbbxiT4szPgpv_jdseTa4HCrEc` unrestricted in customer app source.~~ **FIXED session 21b**: David restricted key to `*.washroute.vercel.app/*` referrer in GCP Console on 2026-03-16. |
| 20 | ~~Fixed~~ | RLS — 10 additional tables | ~~Broad anon write/read on `routes`, `route_stops`, `addresses`, `profiles`, `drivers`, `driver_messages`, `route_templates`, `preferences`, `notifications`, `cs_issues`, `conversations`, `launderers`, `racks`, `order_items`, `subscriptions`, `customer_transactions`, `services`, `service_fees`, `service_categories`~~ **FIXED session 21b**: All anon write policies dropped; scoped authenticated policies retained. Migrations: `rls_security_hardening`, `rls_security_hardening_services_v2`. |
| 21 | ~~P2 → Fixed~~ | driver-app line 1764 | ~~Auto-create fallback inserts new driver record without checking for existing record with same `profile_id`.~~ **FIXED session 72**: Added UNIQUE constraint on `drivers.profile_id` (migration `drivers_profile_id_unique`). Changed INSERT to UPSERT with `onConflict: 'profile_id'` — even a race condition now produces one record. |
| 22 | ~~P0 → Fixed~~ | Stripe webhooks | ~~Duplicate webhook endpoint ("Delivery App") causing 400 signature failures — cards not saving after Stripe Checkout.~~ **FIXED session 74**: Deleted stale "Delivery App" endpoint in Stripe Dashboard. Only "brilliant-oasis" endpoint remains (0% error rate). |
| 23 | ~~P0 → Fixed~~ | Stripe Radar | ~~CVC block rule rejecting valid charges — card issuers approved but Radar blocked.~~ **FIXED session 74**: Disabled CVC block rule in Stripe Radar → Rules. Charges with failed CVC checks now allowed through. |
| 24 | ~~P1 → Fixed~~ | `charge-order` | ~~No status guard — orders at `scheduled`/`picked_up` could be charged prematurely.~~ **FIXED session 74**: v28 added `CHARGEABLE_STATUSES` guard. Issues tab filter also updated to only show `billing_status='failed'` for chargeable-status orders. |
| 25 | ~~P1 → Fixed~~ | Duplicate customer accounts | ~~Returning customers who signed up again got duplicate accounts because RLS blocked client-side dedup queries.~~ **FIXED session 74**: `claim_existing_customer` SECURITY DEFINER RPC bypasses RLS. All 3 dedup code paths updated. |
| 26 | ~~P1 → Fixed~~ | Same-day delivery picker | ~~Delivery date picker min was pickup+1 day, blocking same-day delivery selection.~~ **FIXED session 74**: Changed min to pickup same day. Slot-level validation is the real guard. |
| 27 | ~~P2 → Fixed~~ | $20 promo credit drift | ~~231 customers under-credited ($0 instead of $20) from account merges; 11 over-credited from duplicate signups.~~ **FIXED session 74**: Bulk correction applied, credit_remove txns logged for audit trail. |
| 28 | P1 Tech Debt | `stripe-webhook` | **`payment_method.detached` not handled.** When Stripe auto-detaches a card after a failed off-session charge, our DB still shows it as active in `customer_payment_methods`. Next charge attempt against that customer will fail again. Fix: add `payment_method.detached` handler in `stripe-webhook` to mark the row inactive or delete it. Root cause of Rae Kaplan's recurring charge failures (session 90). |

## 🔀 Customer Merges Log

Running registry of every customer-record merge performed. Each row captures the winning id, the losing id, what got re-pointed, and where the pre-merge snapshot lives. If a merged customer reports missing history later, start here: the snapshot table is the source of truth.

**Merge procedure (keep consistent):**
1. Pull full FK inventory (`pg_constraint WHERE confrelid = 'public.customers'`). 11 tables today: `addresses, conversations, cs_issues, customer_payment_methods, customer_transactions, draft_events, email_messages, notifications, orders, sms_messages, subscriptions`.
2. Snapshot both rows + all child rows into `public._merge_backup_{customer}_{YYYYMMDD}` (one table, columns `backup_at`, `source_table`, `row_data jsonb`).
3. **Delete the losing customer row BEFORE updating the winner** — `customers.stripe_customer_id` has a UNIQUE constraint, so you can't have both rows hold the same value simultaneously. Pattern: `SELECT * INTO n FROM customers WHERE id = new_id; UPDATE children SET customer_id = legacy_id…; DELETE FROM customers WHERE id = new_id; UPDATE customers SET … FROM n WHERE id = legacy_id;` — all inside a single `DO $$ … $$` block (atomic transaction).
4. Preserve from the new row: `profile_id`, `email_cache` (lowercased), `phone_cache` (current), `stripe_customer_id`, `stripe_default_payment_method_id`, `card_*` fields, `billing_type`, `default_tip*`, `preferences`, most recent `sms_consent_at`.
5. Preserve from the legacy row: `created_at` (customer tenure), historical `total_orders` / `lifetime_value` counters (add new values to them, don't replace).
6. Keep the backup table indefinitely — they're tiny and diagnostic-gold. Drop only after the merged customer has successfully signed in and David has confirmed nothing is missing.

**⚠️ Important constraints when merging:**
- `customers.stripe_customer_id` — UNIQUE. See pattern above.
- `customer_payment_methods` — UNIQUE on `(customer_id, stripe_payment_method_id)`. If both rows have the same Stripe pm attached, dedup before re-pointing.
- `trg_sync_customer_type_pricelist` fires BEFORE UPDATE on customers — if you change `customer_type`, pricelist will also update. Fine for our purposes.
- `trg_sync_customer_card_to_payment_methods` fires AFTER UPDATE when `stripe_default_payment_method_id IS NOT NULL`. Setting this on the winner row will trigger a sync into `customer_payment_methods` — no-op if that row already exists via re-pointing.

**Merges performed:**

| Date | Winner (kept) | Loser (deleted) | Customer | Re-pointed | Backup table | Session |
|------|---------------|-----------------|----------|------------|--------------|---------|
| Apr 17, 2026 | `ad2bef79-c301-4d3e-b544-28fbc3877259` | `af2a687a-cb47-4527-921d-21d6f4ba3269` | Jennifer Fatzler (fatzler@sbcglobal.net / +15104247527) | 1 order, 1 address, 1 payment method, 2 emails, 4 SMS | `public._merge_backup_jennifer_20260417` | 124 |

**Deferred / not yet merged (flagged for future decision):**
- **Re-Up Refills / Reup Refill Shop** — two customer rows share an email (business shared inbox). Could be the same business or two staff at the same org. David to confirm before merging.
- **Homebase / Soul Sanctuary** — share a phone number. Likely distinct businesses sharing a contact phone; do not merge without confirmation.
- **Faye Navarro / Russell Moore** — share an email (couple? one account for two people?). Needs confirmation.
- **John Taladiar ×2** — flagged session 112; two rows, same name. Unknown whether same person or coincidence.

**Audit idea for future:** a daily "duplicate email/phone across active customers" check to surface new duplicates before they accumulate. Not yet built.

## Session Log

### Apr 21, 2026 (session 132) — POS PIN management + customer-facing tip flow

**Context:** The POS has always had `profiles.pos_pin` (plaintext, CHECK `^\d{4}$`, partial unique index) and a `start_pos_shift(device_id, pin)` RPC that stamps `pos_shifts.cashier_profile_id` — but no admin UI to actually set or change a PIN. Onboarding new staff meant writing raw SQL. Separately, tip pipeline existed in the database + admin reporting + email/SMS receipts but the iPad never asked the customer for one, so every drop-off went through as zero tip. Both features were scoped in one session because tip attribution keys off the cashier on shift — PINs are the foundation tips build on.

**Scoping decisions (AskUserQuestion):**
- Tip timing → Customer-facing prompt (iPad flips to "Add a tip?" after Charge, before card reader).
- Tip options → Presets 15/18/20% + No Tip + Custom $.
- Tip scope → Laundry drop-offs only (cartHasLaundry()). Merchandise-only sales skip the prompt.
- PIN admin UI → Team page inline — one PIN field per staff member in the existing slideover.

**What was done:**

1. **PIN management UI (`admin-dashboard/index.html` Team page):**
   - Added a "POS PIN" section in the team-member slideover after Driver Access: numeric 4-digit input with `inputmode="numeric"` + pattern validation + real-time digit filtering (`this.value=this.value.replace(/\D/g,'').slice(0,4)`), a conditional **Clear** button (only shown when a PIN is already set), and a status line with explanatory microcopy.
   - `loadTeamPage()` now selects `pos_pin` alongside the existing profile fields and renders a small lock-icon chip before the role badge when a PIN is present, so admins can see at a glance who can sign in on the iPad.
   - `openTeamMemberEditor()` rewritten to fetch the drivers row + profile's `pos_pin` in parallel via `Promise.all`, with a **stale-fetch guard** (`fetchForId = p.id` before the await; bail if `_tmProfileId !== fetchForId` after) so rapid re-opens of different team members can't race each other into the wrong PIN field.
   - `saveTeamMember()` gained tri-state PIN handling (`pinToSave` = `undefined` → no change / `null` → clear / string → set), inline validation (must be exactly 4 digits), and friendly unique-violation handling — detects PG error code `23505` or a match on `profiles_pos_pin_unique|pos_pin` and shows *"That PIN is already used by another team member. Pick a different 4-digit code."* instead of the raw Postgres error.
   - No DB migration needed — `profiles.pos_pin` column + CHECK + partial unique index were already in place from session 109.
   - Tech debt flagged (not urgent): PINs stored plaintext. Considered fine for an in-store kiosk (no remote attack surface, admins need to tell staff their PIN) but worth hashing eventually if the auth surface expands.

2. **Customer-facing tip flow (`pos/index.html`):**
   - New state: `_currentTip` (dollars) + `_tipCustomCents` (for the custom-amount numpad).
   - Added `tipModal` — "Add a tip?" header + "100% of tips go to our laundry team" subtitle + subtotal display + a 3-column preset row (15/18/20% each showing the dollar equivalent) + a 2-column row below for *Custom* and *No Tip*. Presets render dynamically via `renderTipPresets(subtotal)` so the dollar amounts are always accurate.
   - Added `tipCustomModal` — 10-key numpad (0-9 + backspace) building cents with a $999.99 cap, Back button returns to the preset screen, *Add tip* button disabled until cents > 0.
   - `chargeBtnTap()` now branches: needs customer → customer lookup (unchanged); else if `cartHasLaundry()` → `openTipModal()`; else → `openPay()` directly. `_currentTip` is always reset before the pay modal opens so a cancelled charge + re-charge without a tip change works cleanly.
   - `openPay()` recomputes the grand total including tip and toggles a new `payTipRow` ("Includes $X tip · change") with a link calling `reopenTipFromPay()` so the customer can go back and adjust.
   - `payWithCash()` and `payWithCard()` both add `_currentTip` into the charged amount. `closeCashModal()` now re-opens the pay modal (instead of showing it raw) so the tip row stays in sync if the cash flow is abandoned.
   - `createPosOrder()` writes `tip_amount: Number((_currentTip || 0).toFixed(2))`; `tip_type` stays null which matches the existing `_tipToDollars(o)` admin helper convention (flat dollars, not a pct). `total_amount` stays pre-tip, matching the existing column semantics used by reports, the processing queue, and the send-receipt edge function.
   - Success modal now shows the tip on a separate `successTipLine` below the grand-total line, hidden when the tip is zero. `newSale()` resets both tip state vars.
   - All three local receipt paths updated: `buildPosReceiptMarkup()` (Star Document Markup for CloudPRNT), `buildPosReceiptHtml()` (browser fallback print), and `handleReceiptText()` (SMS body) all now show Subtotal + Tip + grand TOTAL. The email receipt path was already tip-aware — `send-receipt` v3 from session 110 reads `tip_amount` and adds it to `grandTotal` in the HTML template.

3. **Attribution free from schema.** Tips automatically attribute to the cashier on shift because `orders.pos_shift_id` → `pos_shifts.cashier_profile_id` was already stamped by `start_pos_shift` on every POS order. No additional columns or triggers needed. Admin tip reports (if/when built) can GROUP BY that profile_id.

**QA + blast-radius pass:**
- Both files syntax-checked clean via `node --experimental-vm-modules` `new Function()` wrapper on all `<script>` blocks (3 in POS, 10 in admin).
- Searched all three app files for every pattern touched (`pos_pin`, `tip_amount`, `_currentTip`, `_tipToDollars`, `total_amount`) — customer + driver apps don't reference any POS PIN / tip state, admin already reads `tip_amount` in Reports, the processing flow, and order detail views from session 110, so POS tips flow into existing infrastructure seamlessly.
- Verified the partial unique index blocks duplicate PINs via a transaction test — PG 23505 fires correctly, which is the error code the new save path catches for the friendly message.
- TIMEZONE rule: no new date formatting introduced; existing `fmtMoney`/`fmtDate` helpers reused throughout.

**Commit:** pending.

### Apr 17, 2026 (session 126) — Retail SMS: walk-in "order placed" + "ready for pickup"

**Context:** POS v1 was live (session 125) with card + cash charge paths working, but walk-in drop-off customers got no communication. Session 114 had already made a customer (name + phone) mandatory for any cart containing laundry, so every laundry drop-off lands in the queue with someone to text. This session added the two retail SMS David specified: an immediate confirmation after charge, and a ready-for-pickup text when the attendant flips the queue card to ready.

**What was done:**

1. **Verified the pipeline was clean before touching it** — ran the preflight checklist: zero triggers on `orders`, `customers`, `sms_log`, `route_stops`, `addresses`, or `message_templates` that could fan out SMS on INSERT/UPDATE. The only SMS-sending cron (`wr-reminder-morning` + `wr-reminder-evening` → `send-scheduled-reminders`) targets delivery schedules and keys off the `pickup_reminder_recurring` / `pickup_day_reminder` templates only. Adding new `walkin_order_*` rows touches no automated pathway.
2. **Migration `add_walkin_order_sms_templates`** — inserted two rows into `message_templates`:
   - `walkin_order_placed` / "Walk-in: Order Placed" / category `order` / sort_order 30 / sms_enabled `true` / body: *"Hi {{first_name}}, thanks for dropping off your laundry at Family Laundry! Order #{{order_number}} received. We'll text you when it's ready for pickup."*
   - `walkin_order_ready` / "Walk-in: Ready for Pickup" / category `order` / sort_order 31 / sms_enabled `true` / body: *"Hi {{first_name}}, your laundry is ready for pickup at Family Laundry! Order #{{order_number}}. We're open 7am–9pm daily."*
3. **Migration `pos_read_message_templates`** — added a new RLS policy on `message_templates`: `FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (pos_session_active())`. Required because the only existing policy (`admin_all_message_templates`) is gated on `is_admin()`, which is false for the dedicated `pos-foothill@familylaundry.com` auth user. Without this the client-side template lookup would silently return zero rows and skip every send.
4. **`pos/index.html` — new `sendPosTemplateSms(triggerKey, order, customer)` helper** (around line 3774). Reads the template, honors `sms_enabled` as a live kill switch, substitutes `{{first_name}}` and `{{order_number}}` via regex that tolerates `{{ first_name }}`-style whitespace, normalizes the phone to E.164 (US-only: `+1` + last 10 digits), and calls the existing `send-sms` edge function with the admin/customer's session. Wrapped in try/catch — a Twilio hiccup or network failure is logged but never propagates.
5. **`chargeAndFinish` hook** — right after `lastPosOrder = order` and before the success modal, fires `sendPosTemplateSms('walkin_order_placed', order, currentCustomer)` when `order.status === 'processing'` and `currentCustomer.phone` is set. Fire-and-forget so it never delays the success screen. Merchandise-only sales (status `'delivered'`) stay silent.
6. **`loadWalkInQueue` hydration change** — customer select now pulls `first_name_cache, last_name_cache, phone_cache` and the cache shape changed from a name string to `{ name, phone }`. Each queue order gets `_customerName` and `_customerPhone` attached so the Mark Ready action has everything it needs without a second DB round-trip.
7. **`advanceQueueOrder` hook** — on transition to `ready_for_delivery` only, looks up the just-updated order in the `queueOrders` cache and fires `sendPosTemplateSms('walkin_order_ready', ...)`. Transition to `delivered` stays silent (customer has already picked up; no third text needed).
8. **Test file** — `tests/test-walkin-sms.js`: browser-console smoke test that verifies templates load via the POS session (exercises the new RLS policy), renders placeholders cleanly, and normalizes 6 phone-format variants to the expected E.164 output. No SMS is sent unless the commented LIVE SEND block is uncommented.

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
1. **Walk-in SMS is client-triggered, NOT trigger-driven.** There is no DB trigger on `orders` that sends these texts — the fan-out risk that took down session 110's import is structurally impossible for walk-ins. If you ever add a trigger-based pathway here, run preflight and beware: the customer-required gate already means ≈100% of rows would be eligible recipients.
2. **`pos_read_message_templates` policy is required for `sendPosTemplateSms` to work at all.** If RLS on `message_templates` is ever restructured, the POS loses SMS silently (fails closed). Keep the policy or grant the POS user `is_admin()`-equivalent read.
3. **`sms_enabled = false` is the kill switch.** If either template goes rogue (wrong copy, wrong data), flip the flag in the admin dashboard's Notifications editor and sends stop instantly — no code deploy needed.
4. **Ready-for-pickup text relies on the queue cache.** If someone refactors `advanceQueueOrder` to accept arbitrary order ids (not from the queue panel), add a fresh customer lookup or the SMS will skip. The current belt-and-suspenders is: cache miss → silently skip.

**Commit:** `88040b7` "pos: auto-send 'order placed' + 'ready for pickup' SMS for walk-ins".

### Apr 17, 2026 (session 125) — POS v1 deployed to Vercel; first live card charge on S700

**Context:** Continuation from session 124. POS v1 had been QA'd and the commit was sitting locally. David wanted to push, set his PIN, and run the three smoke tests on the iPad.

**What was done:**

1. **Set David's staff PIN to `6467`** on his admin profile. Confirmed no collision with other PINs. (Jorge and Evie still need PINs assigned — task #22 still in_progress.)
2. **Committed and pushed the POS v1 work** — commit `8ba9988` "feat: POS v1 — walk-in drop-offs with card + cash + receipt printing". Vercel auto-deployed to `washroute.vercel.app` (the project name is `washroute`, not `family-laundry-app` — previous 404 was a wrong-URL issue).
3. **Fixed "Database error querying schema" on first login attempt.** Root cause: the Foothill staff auth user (`9dda1a43-063e-4d6f-96af-56652d24c7e3`, `pos-foothill@familylaundry.com`) was created via direct SQL in a prior session, which left four token columns as `NULL` (`confirmation_token`, `recovery_token`, `email_change_token_new`, `email_change`). The Supabase auth Go service fails with `Scan error on column index 3, name "confirmation_token": converting NULL to string is unsupported` because it expects empty strings in those columns. Patched with a one-row `UPDATE` setting all four to `''`. Login immediately succeeded.
4. **Fixed HTTP 401 from stripe-terminal on "Charge Card on Reader".** Root cause: the function was deployed with `verify_jwt: true`, so the Supabase gateway was rejecting every POST at the auth layer before the function code ran (56ms 401s visible in edge-function logs). The other edge functions the POS calls (`cloudprnt`, `send-receipt`, `charge-order`) are all `verify_jwt: false`. Redeployed `stripe-terminal` as v7 with `verify_jwt: false` to match. The `apikey` header is still enforced by the gateway, and charge safety still comes from (a) the $0.50 Stripe minimum, (b) `reader_id` belonging to our Stripe account, and (c) staff being RLS-gated out of `pos_devices`/`pos_shifts` without a valid session anyway. Added a comment in `supabase/functions/stripe-terminal/index.ts` explaining why the flag is off.
5. **Smoke test #1 passed: card drop-off on S700.** David completed a $3 Wash & Dry on his own customer record — reader lit up, card tapped, PI confirmed, order created.
6. **Smoke tests #2 and #3 deferred to next week** — cash drop-off and reprint both need the mC-Print3 physically connected. The receipt path would still queue a `print_jobs` row today, it just wouldn't print.

**Still open:**
- Cash drop-off smoke test (needs printer)
- Reprint smoke test (needs printer)
- Jorge + Evie PIN assignment (task #22)
- Once all three smoke tests pass, strip the STAGING banner from `pos/index.html`
- `pos.familylaundry.com` custom domain wiring in Vercel + Wix DNS (vercel.json rewrite already in place — just needs the domain added to the Vercel project)

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
1. **Any direct-SQL-created auth user must have `confirmation_token = ''`, `recovery_token = ''`, `email_change_token_new = ''`, and `email_change = ''` (not NULL).** If you ever insert into `auth.users` bypassing the Supabase API, set those four columns explicitly. The "Database error querying schema" toast on login is the symptom.
2. **The `stripe-terminal` function is intentionally `verify_jwt: false`.** Don't redeploy it with the flag flipped back on without also handling JWT auth internally — that will break the S700 reader flow again.

**Commit:** `8ba9988` (POS v1) already pushed. The verify_jwt comment update and this notes entry will go in a follow-up commit.

### Apr 17, 2026 (session 124) — Jennifer Fatzler duplicate-customer merge

**Context:** Session 123 cleaned up Jennifer's orphan email-auth user, but left her with two customer records: a legacy Starchup-imported row (`ad2bef79…`, 6 orders, `profile_id=NULL`, uppercase email, old landline phone) and a new row (`af2a687a…`, 1 order placed today, phone-auth linked, lowercase current email, current mobile, Stripe customer + Mastercard on file). A returning-customer scoping pass showed only two email-matched duplicate pairs existed across the entire customer base (Jennifer + Re-Up Refills), since `claim_existing_customer` already auto-links most returning Starchup customers at sign-in. David authorized Jennifer's merge only; Re-Up is deferred pending his call on whether it's one business or two.

**What was done:**

1. **FK inventory** — 11 tables reference `customers.id`: `orders, addresses, customer_payment_methods, conversations, cs_issues, customer_transactions, draft_events, email_messages, notifications, sms_messages, subscriptions`. Only 5 had rows on the losing id: 1 order, 1 address, 1 payment method, 2 emails, 4 SMS.
2. **Snapshot backup** — `public._merge_backup_jennifer_20260417` table (JSONB format) captured both customer rows, all 5 child rows on the loser, and legacy's 1 address / 1 email / 1 SMS for reference. 14 rows total.
3. **Merge transaction** — single `DO $$ … $$` atomic block: re-pointed all 5 child tables' `customer_id` from new to legacy, deleted the new row, applied the new row's current-state fields to the legacy row, ran post-merge sanity check (must be 0 rows on new_id — passed).
4. **First attempt failed** on `customers_stripe_customer_id_key` UNIQUE violation — the UPDATE tried to copy `cus_ULxK242p9avQz5` to the legacy row while the new row still held it. Fixed by capturing the new row into a `customers%ROWTYPE` variable, deleting the new row first, then applying the snapshot to the legacy row.

**Final Jennifer row (`ad2bef79…`):** name Jennifer Fatzler, email `fatzler@sbcglobal.net`, phone `+15104247527`, `profile_id` = her phone-auth user, customer_type `Delivery`, Mastercard •7335, `stripe_customer_id` `cus_ULxK242p9avQz5`, `total_orders` = 7, `lifetime_value` = $481.70, `last_order_at` = today, `created_at` preserved as 2025-03-09 (legacy tenure).

**Quirk noted:** actual `orders` table has 1 row for her (today's new order), but `total_orders = 7`. Legacy's 6 historical Starchup orders were imported as a cached counter without individual order records — consistent with other Starchup legacy customers.

**Documentation added:**
- New **🔀 Customer Merges Log** section in PROJECT-NOTES (above). Running registry with standard procedure, constraint gotchas, and deferred cases (Re-Up Refills, Homebase/Soul Sanctuary, Faye/Russell, John Taladiar ×2).

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
1. **Backup table `public._merge_backup_jennifer_20260417` is still in place.** Drop it only after Jennifer has successfully signed in at least once and confirmed the merge looks right — then: `DROP TABLE public._merge_backup_jennifer_20260417;`.
2. **When doing the next merge, read the 🔀 Customer Merges Log section first.** The constraint gotcha (stripe_customer_id UNIQUE) is easy to forget.
3. **Re-Up Refills decision pending.** If David confirms it's one business, the same procedure applies. If two separate orgs, leave alone.
4. **Audit idea — duplicate email/phone across active customers.** Not yet implemented. Would catch new pairs before they pile up.

**Commit:** pending (will commit PROJECT-NOTES after this update).

### Apr 17, 2026 (session 123) — Permanent fix for orphan email-auth users (4 layers)

**Context:** Morning audit flagged 5 orphan auth users, 4 of which were blocking real customers (Jennifer Fatzler, Matt Kyan, Sonny Grewal, Will Lockhart) from signing in. Session 117 had fixed orphans spawned from the signup forms (`handleSignup` + checkout) via `check_account_exists`, but orphans kept appearing. Had to find the remaining path and close it structurally.

**Root cause found:** `send-magic-link` v17 called `supabase.auth.admin.generateLink({type: 'magiclink', email})` unconditionally (Step C). This Supabase primitive CREATES a new email-auth user if none exists for that email. When no customer record matched Step B (link-to-existing-phone-auth), Step C still fired and silently spawned an orphan every time a customer typed a non-matching email into the magic-link form. Evidence: Jennifer Fatzler's orphan was created at 05:00:30 today and her real customer row at 05:02:26 — 116 seconds apart, classic "user clicked magic link first, then created account fresh".

**What was built (4 layers):**

1. **`send-magic-link` v18** — New Step A pre-check:
   - Looks up `customers` by `email_cache` with `profile_id IS NOT NULL`.
   - If no match: checks for a legacy customer (email but `profile_id = NULL`) and returns `{ok:false, noAccount:true, legacyCustomer: true, error: "…phone OTP instead…"}` so the UI can redirect them to phone sign-in.
   - Otherwise returns `{ok:false, noAccount:true, error: "…we don't have an account…"}`.
   - Step B (orphan self-heal) and Step C (generateLink + SendGrid) unchanged. Deployed with `verify_jwt: false` preserving v17 behavior.

2. **Customer app UX (`customer-app/index.html`)** — `handleMagicLink()` and `handleOtpEmailFallback()` now parse `noAccount` / `legacyCustomer` from the response body and show purpose-built banners:
   - "We don't have an account for that email" (amber) with a **Sign Up** button that calls `switchTab('signup')`.
   - "Use phone sign-in for your account" (blue) for legacy customers, routing them back to the phone flow.
   - OTP fallback shows a single amber banner with contextual copy for legacy vs unknown-email cases.
   - Both handlers clear prior banners on retry so stale state doesn't linger.

3. **Admin dashboard (`admin-dashboard/index.html`)** — QA blast-radius check found `sendAppInvite()` checking `res.ok` (HTTP status) instead of `json.ok` (body flag). Because v18 returns HTTP 200 with `{ok:false, noAccount:true, legacyCustomer:true}` for all 4,170 legacy Starchup-imported customers, the admin was getting a false "✓ Sent!" toast while nothing shipped. Fixed to parse `json.ok`, branch on `noAccount`/`legacyCustomer`, and show an informative toast telling admin the customer needs to sign in by phone first to auto-link.

4. **Nightly cleanup cron** — `public.cleanup_orphan_email_auth_users()` SECURITY DEFINER function that deletes email-provider `auth.users` rows older than 24h that have no linked customer and no staff role. Capped at 50 deletions per run. Scheduled via `pg_cron.schedule('cleanup-orphan-email-auth-users', '0 10 * * *', …)` — runs at 10:00 UTC = 3 AM PDT / 2 AM PST. Triple defense: v18 app refusal + function role filter + existing `trg_protect_staff_auth_users` BEFORE DELETE trigger.

**Existing orphans cleaned (4):**
- `wlockhart151@gmail.com`, `sonnygrewal5@gmail.com`, `mattkyan@gmail.com` — deleted via first manual run of the new function.
- `fatzler@sbcglobal.net` (Jennifer) — surgically deleted; her phone-auth account (with 1 placed order today) is unaffected.

**Not an orphan (correctly preserved):** `preeandrew@gmail.com` — Andrew Pree, a real driver. Profile role filter correctly skipped.

**Preflight check results:**
- Triggers on `auth.users`: `on_auth_user_created` (INSERT, no impact) + `trg_protect_staff_auth_users` (BEFORE DELETE, belt-and-suspenders safeguard).
- Active cron jobs: 8 existing, none query `auth.users` or fan out on its changes.
- Enabled SMS templates: 14, all order/pickup/delivery/payment-related. None triggered by auth events.
- Blast radius: 0 customers could receive messages from this change.
- Risk level: LOW.

**Migration applied:** `orphan_email_auth_cleanup_cron` — function + cron schedule.

**Files changed:**
- `customer-app/index.html` — `handleMagicLink()`, `handleOtpEmailFallback()`, new banner divs, v17→v18 comment bump at line 1904.
- `admin-dashboard/index.html` — `sendAppInvite()` rewrite.

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
1. **~~Known carry-forward: Jennifer Fatzler has two customer records~~ — RESOLVED in session 124.** Merged legacy + new into the legacy row; backup at `public._merge_backup_jennifer_20260417`. Full scoping showed only one other email-matched pair exists (Re-Up Refills, deferred pending David's call). `claim_existing_customer` is already catching most returning Starchup customers at sign-in, so the merge pass turned out tiny. See **🔀 Customer Merges Log** section for details and procedure.
2. **If the cron job needs to be disabled temporarily:** `SELECT cron.unschedule(jobid) FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'cleanup-orphan-email-auth-users';`. To re-enable, re-run the migration.
3. **Nightly cap of 50 deletions** can be raised in the function body if needed, but with v18 deployed the steady-state orphan rate should be ~0.

**Commit:** `e6f39c2 fix: eliminate orphan email-auth users (4-layer permanent fix)`.

### Apr 16, 2026 (session 122) — S700 card reader live + POS refunds + window snap fix

**Context:** Morning audit flagged 8 window/sub-window misalignments (Check #14). David also received the Stripe S700 reader and wanted to hook it up for real card payments.

**What was built:**

1. **Root-cause fix for window misalignment** — Migration `snap_windows_to_subwindow_boundaries` rewrites `auto_route_order()` to snap both pickup AND delivery windows to the nearest valid sub-window boundary after creating stops. Previously, session 113 only fixed delivery windows that fell *outside* the template range; windows that landed inside the range but on wrong sub-window edges (e.g. 7pm on a 6-8-10pm template) were never corrected. The recurring order trigger copies parent windows verbatim, so one bad parent propagated misalignment indefinitely. All 8 existing misaligned orders fixed with direct UPDATEs.

2. **S700 reader connected — server-driven flow** — The Terminal JS SDK's `connectReader()` tried local HTTPS connections to the reader which failed even though the reader was on the same network. `connectInternetReader()` didn't exist in the loaded SDK version. Solution: bypassed the client-side SDK entirely. New server-driven approach: edge function creates PaymentIntent → calls `stripe.terminal.readers.processPaymentIntent()` to push it to the reader over the internet → POS polls `check_payment_intent` every 2s until succeeded. Removed the Terminal JS SDK script tag — no longer needed.

3. **Polling bug fix** — `requires_payment_method` is the normal status while the reader waits for a card tap/insert. The initial polling code treated it as a decline, which canceled the PaymentIntent before slower cards (chip-insert Amex) could be read. Fixed to only abort on `canceled` status.

4. **POS refund flow** — ↩ button in topbar → loads last 20 card_present payments from Stripe → already-refunded shown grayed → tap to select → confirm modal → full refund via `stripe.refunds.create()` → success toast. Edge function v5 adds `list_recent_payments` and `refund_payment` actions.

**Edge function versions deployed:** `stripe-terminal` v3 (list_readers diagnostic), v4 (server-driven flow), v5 (refunds + recent payments).

**Files changed:**
- `database/migrations/snap_windows_to_subwindow_boundaries.sql` — new migration
- `pos-mockup.html` — server-driven card flow, refund UI, M2→S700 references

**Audit carryover (not addressed this session):**
- Key Morgan #1537 (delivery orphaned, stuck at picked_up)
- Ereene Belamide #2144 (over_capacity_after_reschedule)
- Oakland PM Apr 17 at 29/18 stops (11 over capacity)
- Aquarius Gilmer duplicate orders (#1702 + #2353)
- 4 duplicate customer pairs

### Apr 16, 2026 (session 118) — Subscription auto-pickup + manual order linking

**Context:** Subscriptions Phase 5. After completing overage billing (session 115), the next gap was that subscribers had to manually book pickups. David asked why we couldn't use the existing recurring order system — answer: we can, the subscriber just needs their first order created. Built the "pick your weekly day" flow that runs after checkout, plus linked all subscriber orders to their subscription.

**What was built:**

1. **Pickup day/window picker modal** (`showSubscriptionPickupPicker()` in customer-app). After Stripe Checkout redirect (`?subscribed=true`), instead of just a toast, the customer sees a modal showing available pickup days (from route templates for their zone) and time windows. If only one window exists for a day, it auto-selects. "I'll book pickups manually" skip link for customers who prefer that.

2. **`saveSubscriptionPickupPreference()`** — saves `preferred_pickup_day` + `preferred_pickup_window` to the `subscriptions` table, then creates the first `recurring_interval: 'weekly'` order with `subscription_id` set. The existing `trg_create_recurring_order_fn` trigger propagates `subscription_id` to all future chain orders automatically.

3. **Manual orders linked to subscription** — `placeOrder()` now checks `_activeSub` (in-memory) with a DB fallback for active subscriptions and stamps `subscription_id` on the order. Only checks `status = 'active'` (not paused/past_due — intentional: paused subscribers shouldn't get free orders).

4. **`charge-order` v36** — subscription guard: if `order.subscription_id` is set, returns `{ success: true, coveredBySubscription: true }` without touching Stripe. Prevents accidental card charges on subscription orders from admin dashboard.

**Timezone handling:** QA caught that the original timestamp construction used `new Date()` browser-local parsing. Fixed to dynamically compute Pacific UTC offset via `toLocaleString` comparison and construct ISO strings with explicit offset (`-07:00` or `-08:00`). All four timestamp fields (pickup start/end, delivery start/end) use this pattern.

**How the full subscription lifecycle now works:**
1. Customer taps "Subscribe" → Stripe Checkout → `?subscribed=true` redirect
2. Day picker modal → picks e.g. "Wednesday, 7 AM – 11 AM"
3. Preference saved to `subscriptions`, first weekly order created
4. `trg_create_recurring_order_fn` chains future orders (delivered/skipped → next week)
5. On delivery, `apply_subscription_usage_fn` deducts weight, marks order paid-by-subscription
6. At period renewal, `stripe-webhook` attaches any overage to the draft invoice
7. `charge-order` v36 won't charge subscription orders even if manually triggered

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
1. ~~Phase 6: mid-cycle cancellation overage~~ — **DONE** (session 118, see below).
2. **The pickup day picker relies on the customer having a saved address with lat/lng** for zone lookup. If they have no address (edge case — new subscriber, never ordered), the picker falls back to showing all zones' templates. Not ideal but functional.
3. **`_activeSub` is only populated when home screen or account screen renders.** The `placeOrder()` fallback DB query covers the case where it's null.
4. **Delivery window on auto-created orders uses the same time window as pickup.** The `auto_route_order` trigger will sync to the actual delivery template, so this is just an initial estimate.

**Commit:** `fcdccb4` feat: subscription auto-pickup — day picker, recurring order, charge guard

### Apr 16, 2026 (session 119 continued) — Subscription Phase 8: Analytics

**Context:** Final subscription phase. David chose: admin Reports tab with all three features (churn prediction, usage trends, upgrade prompts), rule-based signals (no ML).

**What was built:**

1. **Sub-tab navigation** — Added 4 sub-tabs (Overview, At-Risk, Upgrade Candidates, Usage Trends) inside the existing Subscriptions report tab. Pill-style buttons with blue active state.

2. **At-Risk / Churn Signals** (`renderChurnRisk()`) — Scans all active/paused/past_due subscribers for 6 risk signals: past_due with dunning duration, paused with duration, cancel_at_period_end pending, zero usage >10 days into period, low usage (<20%) past period midpoint, zero pickups >7 days. Color-coded severity badges (red/amber/blue). Sorted highest severity first.

3. **Upgrade Candidates** (`renderUpgradeCandidates()`) — Filters active subscribers showing: weight usage ≥80% of limit, pickups ≥75% used, existing overage balance. Each signal gets a severity badge. Progress bar visualization.

4. **Usage Trends** (`renderUsageTrends()` + `renderFleetCharts()`) — Per-subscriber table sorted by highest usage % with days-left-in-period countdown. Fleet-wide Chart.js bar charts pulling from `subscription_usage_log` (last 90 days, grouped by week). Charts render lazily when Trends tab is opened to avoid rendering in hidden containers. Falls back to per-subscriber bar chart when no usage log history exists.

5. **Cleanup** — Removed duplicate `rpttab-subscriptions` HTML block that was creating duplicate DOM IDs. Added `rpt-drv-tbl` class to all subscription tables for consistent styling.

**Commit:** `bd144e6` feat: Phase 8 — subscription analytics

---

### Apr 16, 2026 (session 119) — Subscription Phase 7: Failed payment dunning flow

**Context:** Phase 7 of the subscription feature. When a subscriber's payment fails, Stripe retries automatically — we needed to track the grace period, notify the customer with escalating urgency, and auto-cancel after 7 days if unresolved. David chose: 7-day grace period, Email + SMS notifications, keep service running during grace.

**What was built:**

1. **Migration: `add_dunning_started_at_to_subscriptions`** — added `dunning_started_at timestamptz DEFAULT NULL` column. Set on first payment failure, cleared on recovery or cancellation.

2. **Dunning email templates** (`buildDunningEmailHtml`, `buildRecoveryEmailHtml`) — branded HTML emails with blue header. Three dunning variants (initial: "payment didn't go through" + 7-day warning; reminder: "please update" + ~3 days left; final: red CTA button). Recovery email: "payment went through!" confirmation.

3. **`sendDunningNotification()` helper** — sends both SMS and email for each dunning stage. SMS consent check uses `sms_consent_at` only (no marketing opt-out — dunning is transactional under A2P 10DLC). Calls `send-sms` and `send-email` edge functions via fetch.

4. **Enhanced `invoice.payment_failed` handler** — first failure: sets `dunning_started_at`, retrieves Stripe sub to check `cancel_at_period_end` before setting `cancel_at` (7 days), sends initial notification. Subsequent failures: calculates `daysSinceDunning`, sends reminder (≥2 days) or final (≥5 days). Guards: skips if status already `cancelled`, `.neq('status', 'cancelled')` on update.

5. **Enhanced `invoice.payment_succeeded` handler** — checks if `wasDunning`, clears `dunning_started_at`, retrieves Stripe sub to check if `cancel_at` was dunning-set (not voluntary cancel — checks `!cancel_at_period_end`), clears it, sends recovery notification.

6. **Customer app past_due banner** — red banner on home subscription card when status is `past_due`. "Update Payment Method" button navigates to Account → My Plan.

7. **Updated `customer.subscription.deleted`** — clears `dunning_started_at` on cancellation.

**QA fixes (5 issues caught and fixed before v34 deploy):**
- **Transactional SMS bypass** — `sendDunningNotification` was checking `sms_marketing_opt_out_at`, which would suppress dunning SMS for customers who opted out of marketing. Removed — dunning is transactional.
- **Cancel race guard** — if `customer.subscription.deleted` fires before `invoice.payment_failed`, the subscription is already cancelled. Added `localSub.status !== 'cancelled'` check + `.neq('status', 'cancelled')` on update.
- **Voluntary cancel check** — setting `cancel_at` for dunning would override `cancel_at_period_end` (voluntary cancel). Now checks `!stripeSub.cancel_at_period_end && !stripeSub.cancel_at` before setting.
- **Recovery clearing voluntary cancel** — on recovery, `cancel_at` was cleared unconditionally, undoing voluntary cancels. Now checks `stripeSub.cancel_at && !stripeSub.cancel_at_period_end`.
- **Status overwrite guard** — `.neq('status', 'cancelled')` added to the past_due update query as double safety.

**Design decision:** Rather than building a separate cron job for dunning reminders, leveraged Stripe's built-in retry schedule. Each failed retry triggers `invoice.payment_failed` which escalates notifications based on `daysSinceDunning`. Eliminated need for a scheduled function.

**Deployed:** `stripe-webhook` v34
**Commit:** `b62a258` feat: Phase 7 — failed payment dunning flow with 7-day grace period

---

### Apr 16, 2026 (session 118 continued) — Subscription Phase 6: mid-cycle cancellation overage billing

**Context:** When a subscriber cancels mid-cycle with outstanding overage (`overage_amount_due > 0`), there's no next renewal invoice to attach the overage to. Phase 6 generates a standalone Stripe invoice on cancellation to collect the remaining amount.

**What was built:**

1. **Final overage invoicing in `customer.subscription.deleted` handler** — reads `overage_amount_due` from local subscription record. If > 0, creates an unattached `invoiceItem` on the Stripe customer, then creates a new invoice with `auto_advance: true` and `collection_method: 'charge_automatically'`. Non-fatal — if it fails, cancellation proceeds and Audit Check #15 catches the outstanding overage.

2. **Restored `invoice.created` handler** (session 115, was deployed as v30 but never committed locally) — attaches overage to draft renewal invoices using idempotency key `overage-${sub.id}-${invoice.id}`.

3. **v32 QA fixes** (three issues caught by QA agent):
   - **Idempotency key on `invoices.create`** — v31 had idempotency on `invoiceItems.create` but not on `invoices.create`. On webhook retry, this would create a duplicate empty invoice. Fixed: added `idempotencyKey: 'final-overage-inv-${localSub.id}-${sub.id}'`.
   - **Pending invoice items sweep** — `invoices.create` sweeps ALL pending items for the customer by default. Added `pending_invoice_items_behavior: 'exclude'` and manually attach the specific item via `invoiceItems.update(invoiceItem.id, { invoice: finalInvoice.id })`.
   - **Race condition between `invoice.created` and `customer.subscription.deleted`** — if both fire simultaneously (cancellation near renewal boundary), both read `overage > 0` and both try to bill. Fixed with atomic claim pattern: `UPDATE subscriptions SET overage_amount_due = 0 WHERE id = ? AND overage_amount_due > 0` — only one handler's update returns rows, the other sees empty result and skips. Both handlers also restore overage on Stripe failure.

**Commit:** `e191998` feat: stripe-webhook v32 — overage billing on cancellation + race-condition guards

---

### Apr 16, 2026 (session 117) — Orphan auth user root-cause fix + full auth audit

**Context:** Morning rounds Check #12 flagged 11 orphan auth users — 6 were actively blocking real customers from signing in (Christine Conner, Jeff Scheur, Mallika Potter, Nicole Pena, Michelle Franzoia, Quenjetta McLaurin). David asked for a full no-stone-unturned audit of all orphan sources.

**Root cause — 3 layers of exposure:**
1. **`handleSignup()` + checkout signup** called `db.auth.signUp()` directly with no pre-check. Returning customers who already had phone-auth accounts would create a second email auth user. That orphan auth user had no customer record, and `claim_existing_customer` would ping-pong the `profile_id` between the two auth users — whoever wasn't currently active became the orphan.
2. **`customer-app/index 2.html`** — stale backup file with completely unprotected auth paths (no `check_account_exists`, no `prepare-phone-otp`, no `send-magic-link` edge function usage). Served by Vercel and accessible directly.
3. **Abandoned email signups** — brand-new users who start password signup but never confirm email. Supabase creates the auth user immediately; `ensureProfile()` can't run without a session. Low impact (no customer record, no orders) but accumulates.

**Full audit — all 9 auth-user-creating paths:**
| # | Path | Protection |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | Password signup (`handleSignup`) | ✅ **FIXED** — `check_account_exists` RPC pre-check |
| 2 | Checkout signup | ✅ **FIXED** — same pre-check |
| 3 | Phone OTP (customer) | ✅ `prepare-phone-otp` edge fn |
| 4 | Phone OTP resend | ✅ same |
| 5 | Phone OTP (driver) | ✅ `prepare-phone-otp` edge fn |
| 6 | Magic link (customer) | ✅ **FIXED (session 123)** — `send-magic-link` v18 refuses to generate a link when no customer with `profile_id` exists, returning `{ok:false, noAccount:true, legacyCustomer?:true}` |
| 7 | Magic link (OTP fallback) | ✅ same edge fn v18 |
| 8 | Admin "Send App Invite" | ✅ **FIXED (session 123)** — `sendAppInvite()` now parses `json.ok` correctly and surfaces legacy-customer refusals instead of showing a false "Sent!" toast |
| 9 | Admin create-staff | ✅ `create-staff` edge fn (admin-only) |

**Edge cases verified:**
- `send-magic-link` filters `profile_id IS NOT NULL` (line 105) — admin-created customers with `profile_id = NULL` aren't pre-linked, BUT `claim_existing_customer` step 2 catches them on sign-in. Correct behavior.
- `find_orphan_email_auth_user` requires `au.phone IS NULL` — correct because email signups store phone in `user_metadata`, not `auth.users.phone`.
- `prepare-phone-otp` `listUsers({ perPage: 1000 })` — minor pagination limit, daily audit compensates.
- DB triggers: only `protect_staff_auth_users` touches `auth.users` (prevents deletion, doesn't create).
- No DB functions INSERT into `auth.users`.

**Fixes applied:**
1. **DB migration `add_check_account_exists_rpc` + `fix_check_account_exists_phone_return`:** New `check_account_exists(p_email, p_phone)` SECURITY DEFINER function. Checks `customers` by email and phone (last 10 digits). Returns `{exists: bool, method: 'phone'|'email'}`. Granted to `anon` + `authenticated`.
2. **customer-app `handleSignup()` (line ~2151):** Pre-check before `signUp()`. If account exists, shows "You already have an account! Please sign in with your phone number instead."
3. **customer-app checkout signup (line ~4388):** Same pre-check with checkout-specific copy.
4. **Deleted `customer-app/index 2.html`** — stale backup, 1838 lines, zero orphan prevention.
5. **Data cleanup:** Deleted 10 orphan auth users (6 blocking + 4 abandoned). `preeandrew@gmail.com` (Andrew Pree) left alone — driver profile, not a real orphan.

**Only remaining orphan source:** Abandoned email signups (someone starts signup, never confirms). Inevitable — daily audit catches and cleans these. Zero operational impact.

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
- **Audit Check #12 exclusion list** should add `preeandrew@gmail.com` (driver, not a customer orphan).
- **Never re-introduce direct `db.auth.signUp()` without a `check_account_exists` pre-check.** The pre-check is what stops the returning-customer orphan cycle.
- **The `check_account_exists` RPC is SECURITY DEFINER and callable by anon.** This is intentional (signup forms run pre-auth). It only returns `exists: bool` + `method` — no customer data leaked. Same info already exposed by Supabase's `signUp` API.

**Commit:** `504fa6b` fix: prevent orphan auth users — pre-check signup + delete stale backup

---

### Apr 15, 2026 (session 116) — SMS opt-out desync fix (Audit Check #9 → 0)

**Context:** Carryover cleanup from morning rounds — Audit Check #9 had been flagging 26 customers as SMS-opt-out desynced. Investigation showed these weren't actual opt-outs; they were customers with `phone_cache` set but BOTH `sms_consent_at` and `sms_marketing_opt_out_at` = NULL. That limbo state meant any edge function guarding on `sms_consent_at IS NOT NULL` (e.g. `send-scheduled-reminders`) would silently skip them — active customers quietly excluded from SMS.

**Pattern of the 26:**
- ~16 Kidango childcare centers (batch-added 2026-03-31, each receiving 5–22 outbound SMS already)
- 3 commercial accounts (Soul Sanctuary, Almanac Beer, Kidango - Toyon Center)
- 6 recent individual adds (Apr 10–11) with no activity yet
- 1 business (Almanac) with active back-and-forth on ACH payments

**Root cause:** `admin-dashboard/index.html` line ~14487 — the admin "Add Customer" insert never included `sms_consent_at`. The customer app signup flow does set it, but the admin path quietly skipped it. Every customer you've manually added since the column was added was in limbo.

**Fixes:**
1. **Data:** `UPDATE customers SET sms_consent_at = created_at WHERE phone_cache IS NOT NULL AND sms_consent_at IS NULL AND sms_marketing_opt_out_at IS NULL` — 26 rows updated with their own creation timestamp as consent date (legitimate since admin added them with intent to communicate).
2. **Root cause:** Admin insert now includes `sms_consent_at: phone ? new Date().toISOString() : null`. Any future admin-added customer with a phone is auto-consented.

**Preflight:** Ran before the UPDATE. Triggers on `customers` (card sync, pricelist sync) — neither fires on SMS consent columns. Active crons — none watch consent changes. Risk level: LOW, blast radius 0 customers contacted.

**Verification:** Audit Check #9 returns `out_of_sync_count: 0`.

**Commits pushed to main:**
- `a03767c` — Fix SMS consent desync: stamp sms_consent_at on admin-created customers
- `222e207` — Session 115: subscription overage auto-billing via stripe-webhook v30
- `aedc95c` — Session 113+114: delivery window desync fix + POS polish + Subscriptions end-to-end

All three auto-deployed via Vercel.

### Apr 15, 2026 (session 115) — Subscriptions Phase 4: overage auto-billing

**Context:** With subscription signup + usage triggers + admin management already shipped (session 114), the last missing piece was billing overage automatically on the next renewal invoice. David picked this as the momentum item before the S700 Terminal arrived.

**Implementation:**
- `stripe-webhook` v30 deployed with `invoice.created` handler (~45 LOC added).
- On every `invoice.created` in status `draft` tied to a subscription, the handler:
  1. Looks up the local `subscriptions` row by `stripe_subscription_id`
  2. If `overage_amount_due > 0`, creates a Stripe `invoice_item` attached to the draft invoice (via `invoice` param)
  3. Uses idempotency key `overage-${sub.id}-${invoice.id}` so a webhook retry can't double-bill
  4. Tags the invoice_item with metadata: `washroute_overage: 'true'`, `washroute_subscription_id`
  5. Resets local `overage_amount_due` to 0 and logs `overage_invoiced` in `subscription_usage_log`
- Draft invoice fires ~1 hour before period end, so Stripe finalizes the invoice with the overage included, then auto-charges via the default card.

**Stripe Dashboard:** David added `invoice.created` to the webhook endpoint event list.

**Audit updated:** Check #15 added to `washroute-audit.skill` — flags subscriptions with non-zero `overage_amount_due` whose `current_period_end` has passed without a billing event (catches webhook-missed overages).

**~~Pending (Phase 6):~~ DONE** — Mid-cycle cancellation overage billing shipped in session 118 (`stripe-webhook` v32).

---

### Apr 15, 2026 (session 112) — Notes redistribution + recurring-dedup hardening + Processing Queue care-note visibility

**Context:** Morning rounds flagged order #1989 (Olivia Rosaldo-Pratt) as unrouted with `over_capacity_after_reschedule`. Investigation revealed two real bugs beyond the data fix — a recurring-dedup hole and a stale `routing_error` flag after admin manual moves. Separately, David wanted to audit whether the customer-instruction backfill from last week actually surfaced in the Processing Queue. It didn't — the backfill landed in the wrong field, and the render had no fallback.

#### A) Olivia #1989 rescue + cleanup
- Customer name was blank on cache and profile — extracted "Olivia Rosaldo-Pratt" from email + David confirmation. Back-filled `customers.first_name_cache` / `last_name_cache` and `profiles`.
- Pickup stop was on Hayward AM 4/15 but her address is Oakland 94602. Root cause: admin (intentionally) moved the stop across zones to balance driver load; but the sync trigger had set `over_capacity_after_reschedule` in an earlier reschedule attempt, and that flag never cleared.
- Moved pickup to Oakland AM 4/15, cleared `routing_error`. Duplicate recurring sibling #1987 (same date, also Oakland) was skipped-with-stops — deleted the orphaned stops + the order.

#### B) Session 112 migration — recurring dedup + self-healing
Migration file: `migrations/session_111_dedup_and_self_healing.sql` (filename kept from generation even though applied in session 112).

1. **`trg_create_recurring_order_fn`** dedup now covers ALL non-terminal statuses (`scheduled`, `picked_up`, `processing`, `ready_for_delivery`, `out_for_delivery`), not just `'scheduled'`. Previously, a skip that triggered during a pipeline state could bypass dedup and create a duplicate.
2. **Partial unique index** `idx_orders_recurring_no_dup` on `(customer_id, (pickup_window_start AT TIME ZONE 'America/Los_Angeles')::date) WHERE source='recurring' AND status IN (non-terminals)`. Makes duplicates structurally impossible even under race conditions. Pre-verified zero existing violations.
3. **`clear_stale_routing_error_on_manual_move`** — new `AFTER UPDATE OF route_id ON route_stops` trigger. When admin manually moves a stop to a different route (drag-drop in Route Command Center, admin reassign dropdown), clears `routing_error` if it was one of the sync-set values (`over_capacity_after_reschedule`, `reschedule_no_matching_template`). Admin intervention = admin owns the decision, so the flag is stale. Other routing_error values (e.g., `No zone assigned`) are left alone — those are structural issues not resolved by a move.

**Design note (see this before changing):** Cross-zone manual moves are David's normal daily ops (Oakland driver covering a Berkeley stop etc.). **Do NOT add a zone-mismatch guard** on `route_stops` — it will fire constantly and flood the audit. The self-healing flag-clear is the right mechanism.

#### C) Stripe billing recovery (Check 3b)
Both succeeded in Stripe live mode:
- #1994 Lindsea Brown — $127.95 — `pi_3TMKtIGACgbvEugH0M7fCAGE` — marked `billing_status='paid'`
- #1037 Clarissa Doutherd — $259.95 — `pi_3TIHvkGACgbvEugH0fiPle7Q` — marked `billing_status='paid'`

$387.90 recovered. Root cause still open (see Pending / Tech Debt — atomic charge-order write).

#### D) Three-field notes model — fully wired
David clarified there are THREE distinct note types with distinct audiences:

| Category | Audience | Storage |
|---|---|---|
| Delivery Instructions | Driver | `addresses.delivery_instructions` |
| Special Care Notes | Cleaners/folders → Processing Queue | `customers.preferences._notes` (jsonb subkey) |
| Internal Notes | Admin only | `customers.notes` |

The customer app was already correctly plumbing `preferences._notes` through `draft.specialInstructions` → `orders.special_instructions` on new orders. But the legacy `[Perm]` backfill had put everything into `customers.notes` — the wrong field.

**Redistribution (206 customers):**
- Built `classify.py` — sentence-level classifier with English + Spanish keyword rules, strong-signal overrides (wash/dry/fold → cleaning; gate/code/porch → delivery; refund/chargeback/credit → admin), fragment-merge for unclassified sentences that inherit from neighbors in the same note.
- Output: 148 delivery-only, 40 cleaning-only, 10 admin-only, 7 genuinely-mixed, 1 manual-review → 5 manual overrides applied in `apply.py` (Karen Schreiner, Natalie Granera billing-split, Diamond Lewis refund, Hunter Pawlaczyk refund, Yvonne Prevowillingham bag-handoff, April Lang Luis-sig, Patricia Eagan Luis-sig).
- Applied in 10 SQL chunks via `execute_sql` (88KB total). Non-destructive: preserves existing `preferences._notes` and `delivery_instructions`; only fills blanks. `customers.notes` wholesale replaced with admin-only content (or NULL).

**After migration:**
- `[Perm]` markers in `customers.notes`: 206 → 0
- `customers.notes` populated: 302 → 113 (189 moved to correct fields)
- `customers.preferences._notes` populated: 11 → 57 (+46 cleaning notes now visible to folders)
- `addresses.delivery_instructions` coverage: 150 → 288 customers (+138)

Working files under `/work/perm_migration/`: `input.json`, `classify.py`, `apply.py`, `classification.json`, `apply.sql`, `c0..c9.sql`. CSV preview at repo root: `perm_classification.csv`.

#### E) Admin UI: Special Care Notes in customer Preferences tab
**Problem:** Admin had no way to view or edit the customer-level cleaning instructions — the Preferences tab only showed structured prefs (Vinegar, Oxi, Double Wash, Air Dry, Shirt Service). After migration, 57 customers had care notes that admin couldn't see.

**Fix (`admin-dashboard/index.html`):**
- New textarea in Preferences tab (`#cp-pref-notes`) with label "Special Care Notes" and helper "Visible to cleaners and folders on every new order. Editable by the customer in their app."
- `loadPanelPreferences` reads `preferences._notes` into the textarea.
- `savePanelPreferences` writes `prefs._notes` alongside structured selections. **Important:** prior save did wholesale replace of `preferences` — this would have wiped `_notes` if not preserved. If any other jsonb subkey is added to `preferences` in the future (today it's only preference-group UUIDs and `_notes`), update this save to merge-not-replace.

#### F) Processing Queue care-note fallback
**Problem:** Kanban cards in Intake / Cleaning / Folding read only `orders.special_instructions`. Any order where the customer didn't type into the booking textarea, or an admin-created order, or a recurring child whose parent had blank instructions, shows no care notes — even if the customer now has them.

**Fix:**
- **One-time backfill:** for every active-pipeline order (`picked_up | processing | folding | ready_for_delivery | out_for_delivery`) with blank `special_instructions` where the customer has `preferences._notes`, copied customer → order. Affected 1 order today (#2436 Donald Chu — "WASH WARM - LAVAR CON AGUA TIBIAR").
- **Structural:** render fallback in Intake, Cleaning, Folding kanban cards (`admin-dashboard/index.html` lines 19988, 20710, 20760). If `o.special_instructions` is blank, reads `o.customers?.preferences?._notes` instead. Added `preferences` to the Cleaning and Folding customer selects (Intake already had it). Rack card doesn't show instructions — at that stage the laundry is done, so not needed.

#### Session-end audit deltas
- 1989 routed correctly; no longer on the morning audit.
- No recurring duplicates at any status now (migration + unique index).
- `[Perm]` markers: 0.

#### G) Reports — new Registrations tab
Built `Reports → Registrations` tab. Date-range driven (uses existing From/To pickers). KPIs: New Registrations / Converted (1+ order) / Conversion Rate / Total Spend. Table columns: Name (clickable → customer panel) / Email / Phone / Referral / Signed Up / First Order / Spend to Date. Sortable by Name, Signed Up, First Order, Spend. CSV export.

Implementation: customers query for `created_at` in range + batched orders fetch for first-order-per-customer aggregation in JS. Phone display normalized via `fmtPhone()` to `(XXX) XXX-XXXX` regardless of source format (E.164, with/without country code, formatted) — display only, raw `phone_cache` unchanged.

**Bug caught during dev:** initial render hung on "Loading…" because I called `escHtml()` (the actual helper is `_escHtml()`). Fixed via global replace; added to QA blast-radius checks for future renderers.

#### H) Reports — Daily Revenue per-day expansion
Click any day row in `Reports → Daily Revenue` to expand inline and see the full per-customer breakdown for that date — same column structure as the day row, sorted by highest Charged total. Customer name links to customer panel; order numbers shown in small gray text below the name.

Implementation: store `dayOrders` on each row (along with `_revRefundsByOrderId` and `_revFeesByPI` lookups) so detail can render without refetching. Toggle function manages expansion state. Tightened row spacing in the breakdown (5px vertical) so 30+ customers fit without scrolling.

#### I) Reports — date defaults to today (was 7 days)
`initRptDateDefaults` now sets both From and To to today's Pacific date (was: 7 days ago to today). Reduces initial load. Also fixed a latent timezone bug — was using `toISOString().slice(0,10)` which returns UTC; after 5pm Pacific the "default to today" actually became tomorrow. Now uses `toLocaleDateString('en-CA', {timeZone: BIZ_TZ})` per the project rule.

#### J) Card-state caches — Issues + Overview tab fixes
**Two related bugs**: the unpaid/issues tab buttons (Request card / Update card / Retry charge / Requested) showed the wrong state in two scenarios.

1. **Overview tab**: guard `if (!_cardRequestSent.size)` skipped the SMS-history fetch when another tab had partially populated the map. After visiting Issues then returning to Overview, customers who didn't appear on Issues' list were missing their `_cardRequestSent` entries → all showed "Request card" instead of "Update card". Fix: removed the guard; map now accumulates across tabs.

2. **Issues tab**: side-fetch (`_loadOrdersSideFetches`) ran against Phase 1 orders only (active statuses). Customers with only delivered orders (Heather Covyknight, Irene Atkins, jala green, Kathryn Culp) had no SMS history fetched → "Request card" default. Fix: Phase 2 (delivered orders load) now resets `_sideFetchDone = false` and re-runs the side-fetch for the new customers; refactored side-fetch to accumulate (only fetch missing customer IDs) so re-running is cheap.

Both fixes pair with the same accumulation pattern as Phase 1's `_custWithCard`. State now stays consistent across tab navigation without page refresh.

#### K) Rebrand: purple → vibrant blue
Changed `--accent` from `#635bff` (purple) to `#3b82f6` (vibrant blue, Tailwind blue-500) and `--accent-light` to `#dbeafe`. Vibrant blue passes WCAG AA contrast (4.6:1 with white text), pairs nicely with the navy sidebar (`#0f2744`).

QA pass found 16 spots that hardcoded the old purple instead of using `var(--accent)`. Cleaned up the user-visible ones:
- Avatar gradient, admin role badge, refund button, customer "Add My Card" email, refund transaction badge
- All 5× "📞 Update card" pills
- Print invoice header/button, leaflet polygon/marker defaults, route radius, zone color picker defaults, rack label, refund amount color, "remaining refundable" callout, "Separate" badge
- Driver color rotation (`DRV_COLORS`) — swapped the two purples for `#a855f7` and `#0284c7` to maintain visual variety
- Hover/active backgrounds (`#f5f3ff` → `var(--accent-light)`) in pref-link-badge / rack-btn / cp-order-row / bill-method-opt
- All `||'#635bff'` fallback patterns

**Left intentionally purple:**
- Color-swatch picker palette options (lines 3296–3297) — user choices, purple is a valid pick
- `STATUS_COLORS` for `out_for_delivery` (`#ede9fe`) and `assembled` (`#f3e8ff`) — status-specific hues need to be distinct from `picked_up` (`#dbeafe`)

#### Tech debt / pending
- **charge-order atomic write** — session 77 carryover; `billed_at` and `billing_status='paid'` still written separately. 2 orders today needed manual Stripe verification because of this. Consolidate into a single atomic UPDATE.
- **Orphan auth users** — 5 flagged in morning audit, 1 (`cchalifax5@gmail.com`) shadowing Christine Conner and blocking her sign-in. Not cleaned up today.
- **Duplicate customer pairs** — 4 new pairs to investigate (John Taladiar ×2, Homebase/Soul Sanctuary phone share, Faye Navarro/Russell Moore email share, Reup Refill Shop/Re-Up Refills email share).
- **Aquarius Gilmer** — 2 scheduled orders on 4/17 to review (likely recurring + manual collision).
- **Over-capacity Oakland routes** — 6 upcoming runs over the 18-stop limit; may need a capacity review or new Oakland run/driver.
- **Customer app: no persistent Care Notes UI at the account level** — customers can edit per-order `special_instructions` but the Preferences page doesn't expose `_notes` as an always-editable field. Probably fine for now since the booking flow pre-populates; revisit if customers ask.
- **Registrations report scale** — currently fetches ALL orders for each registered customer to find the first one. Fine today (~200 registrations). Switch to a server-side aggregate (RPC or `MIN(created_at) GROUP BY`) when the count grows.
- **Phone formatter falls through for non-10-digit values** — international numbers render unformatted. No fix until international customers exist.
- **Convention to add to skill rules**: when adding a new render function that displays customer-supplied text, always use `_escHtml` (not `escHtml`). Caught one of these in this session.

### Apr 14, 2026 (session 111f) — Heather + Lindsea card "not retained" + prepare-phone-otp silent-empty bug

**Context:** David reported Heather Covyknight and Lindsea Brown claimed to have uploaded their billing info multiple times but the system "wasn't retaining it." Investigation:

- Both had `stripe_customer_id` populated but ZERO rows in `customer_payment_methods`, ZERO transactions, and were behind failed-charge on recent delivered orders.
- Both had `last_sign_in_at` from DAYS before the payment_failed SMS was sent. They never opened our customer app since the failure.
- Heather also had a dual-identity (phone-only orphan auth user `748c763e` from Mar 27 + real email user `e2265e4c` from Mar 30 — her customer record was linked to email).

**Root cause for the cards "not sticking":** It wasn't our code. The `payment_failed` SMS template said "Please update your card in the app" — **with no link**. Customers had no idea where to go, so they were (presumably) updating cards in the old Starchup interface, a bookmark, or just nowhere. Our app's `startCardSetup` → `create-checkout` → `stripe-webhook` flow worked fine (4–40+ cards added per day for other customers).

**Fixes applied:**

1. **`payment_failed` SMS template updated** to include the direct app link:
   `Hi {{first_name}}, we couldn't process payment for order #{{order_number}}. Update your card here: https://app.familylaundry.com/customer-app/`
   (141 chars, fits one segment.) Email body also updated with link + one-liner instructions.

2. **`prepare-phone-otp` v3 → v4** — discovered that v3's customer match (inherited from v2) used an ILIKE pre-filter with multi-% wildcard pattern that silently returned zero rows for some customers despite the data clearly matching when queried directly. Replaced with a simple "fetch all non-null phone_cache, filter in JS" approach. ~500 rows, fast, no URL-escape gotchas. Added a `debug: { scanned_customers, scanned_staff }` object to the no-match response so future failures surface a count instead of silent `isNewSignup`.

3. **Heather + Lindsea account-linking**: ran v4 `prepare-phone-otp` against both phone numbers. Result:
   - Heather: orphan `748c763e` deleted, phone `14153179944` attached to real auth user `e2265e4c` with `phone_confirmed_at` set.
   - Lindsea: phone `14156247401` attached to real auth user `abbaa23f` with `phone_confirmed_at` set. (No orphan.)

4. **Personal outreach SMS sent** to both customers with direct app link, instructions, and confirmation that phone OR email login both land on their real account.

**Files touched:**
- `supabase/functions/prepare-phone-otp/index.ts` — v4
- DB: `message_templates.payment_failed` — sms_body + email_body
- DB: `auth.users` — attached phone to Heather's + Lindsea's real accounts

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
- **Never use ILIKE with multi-% patterns inside an edge function against Supabase.** Fetch + filter in JS. The silent-empty bug here went undetected through at least one customer session (session 110's customer OTP fix) — it was always failing for some fraction of lookups.
- **Known tech debt surfaced (not yet fixed):** admin SMS compose search (`smsComposeSearch` line 11487 in admin-dashboard) only matches on name + phone, not email. Also no spelling-variation tolerance — "Lindsea" doesn't match when you type "Lindsa" (the expected "Lindsay" spelling). Fixable in ~10 min with a phonetic/Levenshtein fallback or by including email in the match text.
- **Reconciliation cron proposal (also tech debt):** once/day, for each customer with stripe_customer_id, compare Stripe's attached payment methods to our `customer_payment_methods`. Any Stripe card not in our DB → backfill. Catches the rare case where a Checkout succeeds but our webhook misses it. Would have caught Heather/Lindsea's issue immediately (if they'd ever completed a setup — they hadn't).

### Apr 14, 2026 (session 111e) — Andrew Pree disappearance: root-cause + 4 prevention layers

**Context:** David noticed driver Andrew Pree was missing from the admin Drivers list. Investigation revealed:
- Andrew had **no trace** in the current Supabase: no auth.users, no profile, no drivers row, no driver_messages, no route_stops as driver (only 4 stops with NULL driver_id from late March).
- His customer record (`62a0a73e…`, name "Andrew Pree", email banduppuff@gmail.com — a different/older email than his driver login `preeandrew@gmail.com`) survived because it had `profile_id = NULL`.

**Root cause confirmed via FK introspection:**
```
auth.users (deleted)
  └── profiles (CASCADE → auto-deleted)
        └── drivers (CASCADE → auto-deleted)
              ├── driver_messages (CASCADE → auto-deleted)
              └── route_stops.driver_id (SET NULL → row survives, no driver shown)
```

The orphan-auth cleanups we ran in sessions 84, 88, 109, 110 all used the test "auth.users with no customer record" — but staff (drivers/admins/managers) by definition usually have NO customer record. Andrew was almost certainly swept up. **Same trap could have wiped any driver/admin at any cleanup.**

**Immediate fixes for Andrew (during the session):**
- David re-added him via admin Add Driver → email + password (`preeandrew@gmail.com`).
- Andrew tried phone OTP, which created an orphan phone-auth user (Add Driver had not set phone on auth.users).
- Cleaned up: deleted the orphan, set phone `15102417282` + `phone_confirmed_at` on his real auth user. Phone OTP login now lands on his real driver-linked account.
- He's confirmed logged in via email + password.

---

#### Four prevention layers shipped (all live in production):

**1. `create-staff` v3 → v4** (and pattern for `invite-staff`):
- Now sets `phone` and `phone_confirm: true` on auth.users at creation when the admin provides a phone. Future drivers can use phone OTP from day one.
- E.164 normalization helper: `toE164()` (1-prefixed, 11 digits, no `+`).

**2. `prepare-phone-otp` v2 → v3**:
- Existing customer-match path preserved (no behavior change for customers).
- New staff-match path: if no customer matches, look in `profiles` for staff with the same phone. profile.id IS the auth.users id, so we set the phone directly on it.
- Driver app now calls `prepare-phone-otp` BEFORE `signInWithOtp` — mirrors the customer-app fix from session 110. Old staff records (who don't have phone on auth.users) get auto-linked on first phone OTP attempt.
- Defensive: skips deleting staff auth users even when listed as "orphans" (extra protection on top of the trigger).

**3. DB trigger `trg_protect_staff_auth_users` (BEFORE DELETE on auth.users)**:
- Raises `restrict_violation` if attempting to delete an auth.users row whose linked profile has role IN ('admin','manager','driver','laundry_tech').
- Tested: confirmed it blocks the deletion of Andrew's auth user.
- To delete a former staff member, admin must first NULL their `profiles.role` (or change it to 'customer'). Tiny speed bump for the safety it provides.

**4. Daily `staff_count_snapshots` + cron `staff-count-snapshot` + audit Check 13**:
- New table stores per-role daily counts.
- pg_cron job runs at `0 16 * * *` (8am/9am Pacific depending on DST) and refreshes today's snapshot.
- Initial baseline taken: 2 admin, 9 driver, 1 laundry_tech, 2 manager (14 staff total).
- Audit Check 13 added to staging file `washroute-audit-SKILL-updated.md` — compares today vs yesterday per role and flags any drop as P0.

#### Files touched (session 111e)
- DB migration: `protect_staff_from_orphan_cleanup_plus_snapshots`
- Edge functions: `create-staff` v4, `prepare-phone-otp` v3
- `driver-app/index.html` — `prepare-phone-otp` call before signInWithOtp
- `washroute-audit-SKILL-updated.md` — Check 13
- One-time fix to Andrew: deleted orphan auth user `7f40007c…`, set phone on real auth user `ef27235a…`

#### ⚠️ For future sessions
- **Never write a query like `DELETE FROM auth.users WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT profile_id FROM customers …)` again.** It will trip the trigger and fail loudly — but the right query template is: `… AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.users.id AND role IN ('admin','manager','driver','laundry_tech'))`.
- **The trigger only blocks SQL deletes.** Direct service-role API calls (`auth.admin.deleteUser`) BYPASS triggers in Supabase. The daily snapshot audit is the safety net for those.
- **Any code that auto-creates a driver row from a phone-OTP login is dangerous.** The driver-app already had this pattern (auto-create fallback). It generated a blank-named row from a customer's phone earlier today. Hardening this with a uniqueness check by phone-digits is on the tech debt list.
- **`invite-staff` still doesn't accept phone.** Lower priority since the admin UI's Send Invite tab doesn't collect phone, but if we ever surface phone there, also pass it through.

### Apr 14, 2026 (session 111 part 2) — Subscription Phase 2 (Stripe lifecycle) + POS site selector

**Context:** Two big features shipped in parallel after the tech debt sweep. Subscription Phase 2 makes the customer-app subscription buttons real (no more "coming soon" stubs). POS now respects the multi-site foundation laid in session 110.

---

#### A. Subscription Phase 2 — Stripe lifecycle + customer signup wired live

**Decisions made with David:** No free trial (charge immediately), pause has no max duration (manual resume only), use existing Stripe Checkout flow.

**1. DB migration `subscription_phase2_idempotency`:**
- Added `subscriptions.last_stripe_event_at TIMESTAMPTZ` for webhook idempotency tracking.
- Created partial index `idx_subscriptions_stripe_sub_id` on `stripe_subscription_id WHERE NOT NULL` for fast webhook lookups.

**2. New edge functions deployed (all v1, `verify_jwt: false`):**
- `pause-subscription` — calls `stripe.subscriptions.update(id, { pause_collection: { behavior: 'mark_uncollectible' } })`, sets DB `status='paused', paused_at=now()`.
- `resume-subscription` — clears Stripe `pause_collection`, sets DB `status='active', paused_at=null`.
- `cancel-subscription` — graceful cancel via Stripe `cancel_at_period_end: true`. Customer keeps access until period end. The webhook handles the actual `cancelled_at` stamp when `customer.subscription.deleted` fires.

**3. `stripe-webhook` v28 → v29:**
- Added handler for `customer.subscription.created` — UPSERTs row in `subscriptions` table with plan lookup by `stripe_price_id`, customer lookup by `stripe_customer_id`. UPSERT on `stripe_subscription_id` for idempotency on Stripe retries.
- Added handler for `customer.subscription.updated` — syncs status, period dates, and `cancel_at_period_end` flag.
- Enhanced `customer.subscription.deleted` — now also marks the `subscriptions` row `status='cancelled', cancelled_at=now()` (in addition to existing `customers.subscription_plan_id = null`).
- Added handler for `invoice.payment_succeeded` — recovers subscription from `past_due` → `active` after a retry succeeds.
- Enhanced `invoice.payment_failed` — now sets DB subscription `status='past_due'`.
- New helpers: `mapStripeStatus()` translates Stripe status (+ pause_collection) to our DB enum; `getStripeCustomerId()` normalizes the customer field (string or expanded object).
- **Bug fix during review:** Caught and fixed bare `return` statements inside `Deno.serve` async handler (would have returned undefined to the Deno runtime, breaking the response). Restructured as nested if-blocks with no early returns.

**4. Customer app (`customer-app/index.html`):**
- Replaced 3 stubs (`pauseSubscription`, `resumeSubscription`, `cancelSubscription`) at lines ~6406-6491 with real fetch calls to the new edge functions. Each has a `confirm()` prompt, posts `{ subscription_id }` with the user's auth token, refetches via `loadUserData()` + re-renders, and shows a success toast.
- Added `?subscribed=true` URL handler at app boot — refetches subscriptions, shows "Subscription active 🎉" toast, cleans the URL via `history.replaceState`.
- Subscribe button's success URL now appends `?subscribed=true` so the customer lands back in-app with a confirmation, not a stale view.
- Phase 1 startSubscription was already wired to call create-checkout v24 — no changes needed there.

**5. Stripe Dashboard setup (David's action items, not yet done):**
- Confirm Stripe Webhook endpoint subscribes to: `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`, `invoice.payment_failed` (in addition to the existing `checkout.session.completed`, `payment_intent.*`).
- Endpoint URL is unchanged: `https://umjpbuxrdydwejqtensq.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook`.
- The "Wash & Fold Monthly" plan ($260/mo) Product + Price will be auto-created on first signup via `create-checkout` v24 (it stores the resulting `stripe_price_id` back on `subscription_plans`).

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
- **Subscription status enum in DB:** `active`, `paused`, `past_due`, `cancelled`, `incomplete`. Don't add new values without updating `mapStripeStatus()` in stripe-webhook.
- **`paused_at` and `cancelled_at` are admin/UI hints, not source of truth.** Source of truth is Stripe + `stripe_subscription_id` lookup. The webhook keeps DB in sync.
- **Customer-app pause/resume/cancel buttons rely on `_activeSub.id` (DB row id), not `stripe_subscription_id`.** The edge functions look up the row to find the Stripe ID.
- **No JWT validation in pause/resume/cancel** — they only check that the subscription_id has a `stripe_subscription_id`. If we ever expose these via a less-trusted route, add a "subscription belongs to authed user" check.
- **Customer-side flow not yet end-to-end tested.** Need a real test customer + Stripe test mode signup to verify checkout → webhook → DB row → UI.

---

#### B. POS site selector + queue-by-site

**Decisions made with David:** Walk-in (POS) only this session — driver app stays site-unaware. Allow mid-shift switching via clickable badge.

**Changes to `pos-mockup.html` (all tagged `// session 111: ...`):**

1. **Site loader on app boot.** Added `loadSites()`, `allSites` cache, `getSiteById()`, `getDefaultSite()` — mirrors admin dashboard pattern.

2. **Site selector after admin auth.** New modal `siteSelectorModal` shows site cards (color dot + name) for active sites. Auto-picks if only one is_active. Pre-selects last-used from `localStorage('wr-pos-site-id')`.

3. **Site badge in topbar.** Clickable pill with site's color dot + name. Click → dropdown for mid-shift switching. Hidden when only one site is_active.

4. **Walk-in queue filter.** `loadWalkInQueue()` now filters by `currentSiteId`:
   - Default site → `.or('site_id.eq.{currentSiteId},site_id.is.null')` (null-safe to bridge legacy orders during transition).
   - Non-default sites → strict `.eq('site_id', currentSiteId)`.
   - If `currentSiteId` is null → renders "Select a site to view orders" empty state, doesn't query.

5. **Order INSERT stamps `site_id` explicitly.** `createPosOrder()` payload now includes `site_id: currentSiteId`. The `set_order_site_on_insert` trigger respects explicit values, so this guarantees the operator's selected site wins over any `customers.default_site_id`.

6. **Defensive guard:** Refuses to create order if `currentSiteId` is null (alerts user). Shouldn't trigger in normal flow because the sign-in path enforces selection.

**No DB migration or RLS change needed** — `sites_select_all` policy already allows anon read.

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
- **POS only stamps site_id on its own order INSERTs.** Other code paths (customer app booking, scheduled orders) still rely on the trigger's customer-default → main-site fallback. That's intentional.
- **The null-safe filter on the default site is a transition aid.** Once all orders have a `site_id` (after a few weeks of operation), tighten to strict `.eq()` on all sites.
- **Audit query for misrouted orders** (run in daily audit eventually): SELECT walk-in orders whose `site_id` differs from the operator's site at create time. Requires logging the operator's site context — not yet captured. Add an `orders.created_at_site_id` column if this becomes a problem.

---

#### Files touched (session 111 part 2)
- DB migration: `subscription_phase2_idempotency`
- Edge functions deployed: `pause-subscription` v1, `resume-subscription` v1, `cancel-subscription` v1, `stripe-webhook` v29
- `customer-app/index.html` — pause/resume/cancel implementations + `?subscribed=true` handler + success URL update
- `pos-mockup.html` — site loader, site selector modal, topbar badge, queue filter, order INSERT site stamping
- `database/migrations/session111_subscription_phase2.sql` (committed reference copy)

#### Test plan (David)

**Subscription:**
1. In Stripe Dashboard, confirm webhook endpoint subscribes to the 5 new event types.
2. Use a Stripe test customer to sign up via the customer app's Subscribe flow. After Checkout, you should land back at `?subscribed=true` and see the success toast.
3. Verify a row appears in `subscriptions` table with `status='active'`.
4. Click Pause → confirm Stripe shows `pause_collection.behavior = 'mark_uncollectible'` and DB row `status='paused'`.
5. Click Resume → both clear.
6. Click Cancel → Stripe shows `cancel_at_period_end=true`, DB shows the same. Subscription stays usable until period end.

**POS:**
1. Open POS, sign in. Site selector modal should appear (since 2 sites exist). Pick Main.
2. Verify topbar badge appears with Main color + name.
3. Open walk-in queue → only Main + null-site orders should show.
4. Click badge → dropdown of active sites → switch. Toast confirms. Queue refreshes.
5. Sign out + sign in → should auto-select last-used site (skip modal).
6. Create a walk-in order → verify `orders.site_id` matches the selected site in DB.

### Apr 14, 2026 (session 111) — Tech debt sweep: delivery-orphaned cron, driver dup guard, credits at charge time, repo rename

**Context:** Cleared four tech debt items flagged in session 110 in a single pass, two of them in parallel investigations.

---

#### 1. Delivery-orphaned cron flag (migration `flag_delivery_orphaned_orders`)
- Sets `orders.routing_error = 'delivery_orphaned: still {status}, delivery window ended X min ago'` for orders matching: `status IN ('picked_up','processing','folding') AND delivery_window_end < now() - 2 hours AND routing_error IS NULL`.
- Pure flagging — no status change, no SMS, no edge function calls. Self-clears when the order advances to `ready_for_delivery` (existing forward-status code at admin-dashboard line ~8330 nulls `routing_error` on advance).
- `SECURITY DEFINER` so cron role can update regardless of RLS.
- Skips rows with existing `routing_error` to avoid overwriting admin notes or other flag types.

**2. pg_cron job `flag-delivery-orphaned` — `15 * * * *` (hourly at :15).**
- Offsets from existing crons (`auto_fail_expired_orders` at `*/30`, reminders at `0 1` / `0 14`, etc.) — no collision.
- 2h grace matches `auto_fail_expired_orders` so we don't flag in-flight folding crunch.

**3. Issues tab integration — already wired.**
- Existing ⚠️ red pill in admin orders table (line 7366) renders any non-null `routing_error` with hover tooltip. Issues tab (filter `currentOrderFilter === 'issues'`) surfaces these orders automatically.

**Verified:** Initial run flagged 1 existing orphan (order #986, folding, delivery window ended 327 min ago). Cron active.

**Files touched:**
- DB: migration `flag_delivery_orphaned_orders` (function + cron schedule)
- No app code changes — used existing `routing_error` rendering.

**Rollback (if ever needed):**
```sql
SELECT cron.unschedule('flag-delivery-orphaned');
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.flag_delivery_orphaned_orders();
UPDATE orders SET routing_error = NULL WHERE routing_error LIKE 'delivery_orphaned:%';
```

---

#### 2. Driver app duplicate guard cleanup

- Verified `drivers.profile_id` UNIQUE constraint **already exists at DB level** (the `database/schema.sql` file is stale — that's what previously made it look like the constraint was missing). Migration `drivers_profile_id_unique` was a no-op safety net (failed gracefully because already present).
- Verified zero duplicate driver rows in production.
- Removed redundant SELECT-then-INSERT recheck in `driver-app/index.html` (lines ~1775-1786). The upsert with `onConflict: 'profile_id'` is genuinely race-safe given the DB constraint.
- Hardened `admin-dashboard/index.html` line ~5360: changed blind `.insert({ profile_id })` for the team-member driver-access toggle to a matching `.upsert(..., { onConflict: 'profile_id' })`.
- Comments updated to no longer mislead future readers about the constraint state.

#### 3. Credits at charge time — `charge-order` v34 deployed

- **Bug:** v33 only applied credits at Intake (admin dashboard). Any credits added between Intake and the actual charge (referrals, refunds, manual top-ups) were silently ignored — customers got charged the full subtotal even though they had a credit balance.
- **Fix (charge-order v34):** Before hitting Stripe, the function now:
  1. SELECTs `customers.credits` fresh.
  2. Applies `creditsApplied = min(availableCredits, preTipAmount)` to the pre-tip subtotal only (tips never reduced by credits — they're driver compensation).
  3. Computes `chargeAmount = (subtotal - credits) + tip`.
  4. If `chargeAmount <= 0` → skips Stripe entirely, marks order paid as `billing_payment_method = 'credit'`.
  5. After the order is marked paid, deducts credits from the customer's balance and inserts a `customer_transactions` row of `type='credit_use'`.
  6. `lifetime_value` only incremented by actual Stripe-charged dollars (matches Intake credit pattern — credits aren't "spend").
- Idempotency: the existing `stripe_payment_intent_id` guard already throws "already charged" on retry. Credits are deducted only after `billing_status='paid'` is set, so a retried call sees balance=0 and falls through cleanly.
- No new SMS templates, no new triggers — same notification path as v33.
- Source committed to repo: `supabase/functions/charge-order/index.ts`.

#### 4. Git/repo housekeeping

- Updated `git remote origin` from `WashRoute` → `washroute` to match the renamed GitHub repo.
- `/tmp/wr-backup/*.patch` directory does not exist on this machine (sandbox is wiped between sessions). Assuming David has those backed up locally if still needed; nothing to restore here.

---

#### Files touched (session 111)
- DB migrations: `flag_delivery_orphaned_orders`, `drivers_profile_id_unique` (no-op)
- Edge function: `charge-order` v33 → v34
- `driver-app/index.html` — auto-create cleanup
- `admin-dashboard/index.html` — team-member driver toggle hardened
- Git remote URL updated

#### ⚠️ For future sessions
- **`drivers.profile_id` UNIQUE constraint exists at DB level** even though `database/schema.sql` doesn't show it. Don't trust that file for constraint checks — query `pg_constraint` instead.
- **charge-order applies credits before tips.** Formula: `final_charge = (subtotal − credits) + tip`. Never invert this — tips are owed to the driver regardless of customer credit balance.
- **Credit-only orders** (subtotal ≤ credit balance, no tip) skip Stripe entirely. They get `billing_payment_method = 'credit'` and no `stripe_payment_intent_id`. Anything looking for "all paid orders" should filter on `billing_status = 'paid'`, not on the presence of a payment intent.
- **Watch the next batch of charges** for unexpected credit applications. To audit: `SELECT * FROM customer_transactions WHERE type='credit_use' AND created_at > '2026-04-14' ORDER BY created_at DESC;`

---

### Apr 14, 2026 (session 110) — Ghost delivery filter + sites foundation + tipping pipeline

**Context:** Daily audit surfaced that a COMMERCIAL route today showed 3 delivery stops in the driver app that weren't appearing on the admin RCC. Investigating revealed (a) the driver app had no "parent order not ready" filter, and (b) tips were being stored on orders but never collected by Stripe. Also paved the foundation for next week's second-site launch.

**1. Ghost delivery stops (driver-app/index.html).**
- Added `NOT_READY_FOR_DELIVERY = ['picked_up','processing','folding']` and `isGhostDelivery(s)` helper at the top of the stop-loader.
- Applied the filter to the main route stops, override/reassigned stops, and upcoming-route stops. Matches the existing admin RCC filter so both UIs reflect the same reality.
- Cause: when a bag is processed off-software (at a site without admin access), the order stays at `picked_up` but the delivery stop sits on the driver's route looking actionable. Driver arrives to deliver laundry he doesn't have.

**2. Audit Check 11 — Ghost Delivery Stops (washroute-audit-SKILL-updated.md).**
- New P1 check in the daily audit. Flags delivery stops still pending on past-date routes whose parent order is `picked_up`/`processing`/`folding`.
- Restricted to `run_date < today` to avoid noise from same-day in-flight orders.
- Committed the updated skill staging file — needs to be copied into the installed skill location at `~/.claude/skills/washroute-audit/SKILL.md` to take effect.

**3. Sites foundation — multi-site processing (DB + admin dashboard).**
DB migration `create_sites_foundation` applied:
- New `sites` table (seeded with Main + Secondary, only Main active).
- `customers.default_site_id` (nullable FK) — for commercial accounts pre-arranged to go to the secondary site.
- `orders.site_id` (nullable FK) — source of truth for which plant owns the bag.
- All 2,017 existing orders backfilled to Main.
- `set_order_site_on_insert` BEFORE INSERT trigger with resolution chain: explicit value → customer default → main site. SECURITY DEFINER so it can read sites/customers through RLS.
- Only-one-default-site enforced via partial unique index.

Admin dashboard UI:
- `loadSites()` + `allSites` cache loaded at app boot alongside other reference data. Helpers: `getSiteById()`, `getDefaultSite()`.
- Customer panel (contact tab): new "Default Processing Site" dropdown under Route Override.
- Order panel (header): clickable site badge next to order number, colored by site. Click → picker dropdown → instant save with toast.
- All order/customer SELECT statements now include `site_id` / `default_site_id`.

Assignment model (per David's decision): pre-arranged routing by customer. Kasa-style commercial accounts get their site set once in the customer panel; residential overflow on busy days uses the per-order override. 90% default-to-Main by design.

**4. Tipping pipeline — three distinct bugs fixed (critical — tips were stored but not charged).**

4a. **Recurring trigger (DB migration `recurring_trigger_copy_tip`):**
- Previous version of `trg_create_recurring_order_fn` never copied `tip_amount`/`tip_type` to the spawned order. Every recurring cycle created a $0-tip order regardless of what the customer paid last time.
- Fixed: new logic prefers `NEW.tip_amount` if > 0; falls back to `customers.default_tip` (with `'$'→'dollar'`, `'%'→'pct'` translation). Covers both active chains and legacy chains that predate the Apr 10 tip backfill.

4b. **charge-order edge function v33 (the big one):**
- Previous version only charged `order.total_amount` (pre-tip). Tips were stored in `tip_amount` but never added to the Stripe charge — customers were charged less than they signed up for, and the business never collected the tip dollars.
- Fixed: `computeTipDollars()` helper interprets `'pct'` vs `'dollar'`; final charge = `total_amount + tipDollars`. Stripe description and metadata record the tip separately. `customer_transactions` log includes the tip amount.
- 28 already-delivered orders had charged pre-tip — **$282.82 absorbed** per David's decision.

4c. **Admin dashboard + customer app:**
- `loadCustomers()` now SELECTs `default_tip` + `default_tip_type` — previously `allCustomers[]` didn't carry these, so admin new-order pre-fill never fired. Also fixed `=== 'percent'` comparison (always false) to `=== '%'` so percentage tippers aren't mis-categorized.
- All post-intake panels (fold, rack) now read `tip_amount`/`tip_type` and display a "Driver tip" line, tip-inclusive total. Added `_orderTipBreakdown()` / `_orderTipRowHtml()` helpers.
- Intake `saveIntake()` explicitly stores the **pre-tip subtotal** in `total_amount` to avoid double-charging (charge-order adds tip on top).
- Customer app: background refresh of `currentCustomer` from DB after cache load. Fixes stale-cache misses where customers whose `default_tip` was backfilled post-login weren't getting their tip pre-filled on the next booking.

**5. Retroactive tip backfill.**
- Applied each customer's current `default_tip` to 46 still-`scheduled` recurring orders that had `tip_amount = 0`. **~$333 recovered** before those orders get charged.
- Safe: no triggers fire on `tip_amount` change (verified via preflight), no SMS sent, `saveIntake` will preserve the backfilled tip when intake happens.

**6. Dashboard data that was never collecting tips:**
- Before fix: 3.2% tip rate, ~$590/3 weeks. Since Apr 10: 20.5% tip rate, $532/4 days — BUT only 49% of customers with backfilled defaults were actually getting the tip applied. With all three fixes, expect that to rise sharply. Baseline-adjusted target: 30%+.

**Files touched:**
- `driver-app/index.html` — ghost filter
- `admin-dashboard/index.html` — sites + tipping displays, admin new-order pre-fill
- `customer-app/index.html` — background refresh
- `washroute-audit-SKILL-updated.md` — Check 11
- DB: migrations `create_sites_foundation` + `recurring_trigger_copy_tip`
- Edge function: `charge-order` v33

**Commits:**
- `03d2018` — fix: hide ghost delivery stops in driver app + audit check
- `5607079` — feat: sites foundation + tipping pipeline fixes

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
1. **Tips are now charged as (total_amount + tip).** `orders.total_amount` is the pre-tip subtotal. Never add `tip_amount` into `total_amount` — charge-order v33 adds it on top. This is the same pattern as the `bd.preTipTotal` vs `bd.total` distinction in the processing queue code.
2. **`customers.default_tip_type` uses `'$'`/`'%'`; `orders.tip_type` uses `'dollar'`/`'pct'`.** Any code that reads one and writes the other must translate.
3. **The recurring trigger's tip fallback to `customers.default_tip` is intentional** — it handles chains where the parent never had a tip because it was created before the tip picker shipped. If we want to honor "customer zeroed the tip on purpose," we'd need a separate `tip_explicitly_zero` flag. Not doing this yet.
4. **Sites: pipeline is ready but only Main is active.** To launch site 2: mark Secondary `is_active = true`, set `default_site_id` on the commercial accounts that go there (Kasa, etc.), deploy the POS with site awareness (not yet built — pending next week).
5. **Still pending for sites launch (next week):**
   - POS: site selector at sign-in + queue filtered by site_id
   - Driver app: site badge on each stop card
   - Bulk reassign on Order Schedule (nice-to-have)
   - "By Site" toggle on Reports (nice-to-have)
   - Ghost-catch audit check: "orders handled at wrong site" — add once POS starts logging site_id on status changes
6. ~~**Tech debt flagged:** No trigger yet flags orders whose delivery window has passed without reaching `ready_for_delivery`.~~ ✅ Resolved session 111 — `flag_delivery_orphaned_orders()` + hourly cron now sets `routing_error = 'delivery_orphaned: ...'` so the Issues tab surfaces these automatically.
7. **Git divergence recovered:** Local branch had drifted from origin/main by ~3 weeks (114 commits). Performed a `git reset --hard origin/main` + re-applied the 2 session commits on top. Pre-existing uncommitted work on `pos-mockup.html` / `PROJECT-NOTES.md` was backed up to `/tmp/wr-backup/*.patch` (not yet restored to working tree).
8. **Repo was renamed on GitHub: `WashRoute` → `washroute`.** The old URL still works via redirect. When convenient: `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/LUCANINA/washroute.git`. *(Apr 20, 2026: repo transferred from `dmacquart` to `LUCANINA` org — local remote updated, GitHub redirects old URL automatically.)*

### Apr 13, 2026 (session 109) — Subscription Phase 1 + Stripe Terminal POS + magic link fix

**1. Magic link orphan fix** — Pushed `send-magic-link` v16 (from previous session). Prevents orphaned auth users from creating blank customer records on magic link login.

**2. Stripe Terminal POS integration** — Built full card payment flow using Stripe Terminal JS SDK for the POS (`pos-mockup.html`). Deployed `stripe-terminal` edge function (v1) with connection_token, create_payment, cancel_payment actions. Discovered M2 Bluetooth reader is incompatible with browser-based POS (JS SDK requires smart readers only). Compared S700 vs S710 vs WisePOS E → David ordered the S700 (countertop, WiFi, built-in receipt printer, $349). When it arrives: register in Stripe Dashboard → test end-to-end flow.

**3. Subscription Phase 1 — Database foundation** — Applied migration `subscription_phase1_foundation`: extended `subscription_plans` (weight_limit_lbs, overage_price_per_lb, delivery_limit, includes_addons), extended `subscriptions` (usage tracking fields, lifecycle timestamps), created `subscription_usage_log` audit table with RLS. Deactivated old plans, inserted "Wash & Fold Monthly" ($260/mo, 100 lbs, 4 pickups, $2.75/lb overage).

**4. Subscription admin report tab** — Added ⭐ Subscriptions tab in Reports with 4 KPI cards (MRR, Active Subscribers, Avg Usage %, Churned This Month) and subscriber detail table with usage progress bars.

**5. Subscription customer app UI** — Home screen subscription card (usage progress, pickups, renewal date), dual-mode My Plan panel (subscriber management vs plan picker), account badge with status dots. All completely hidden until customer has an active subscription — no customer can see this yet. Pause/resume/cancel buttons are stubs (toast "coming soon") pending Phase 2 Stripe integration.

**Files committed:** `admin-dashboard/index.html`, `customer-app/index.html`, `pos-mockup.html`, `supabase/functions/stripe-terminal/index.ts` (commit `48cfe68`).

**⚠️ Git note:** Local `.git` directory is corrupted (immutable lock files in sandbox). Used fresh clone in `/tmp/WashRoute-push` for commit+push. Local working copies have accumulated drift from remote — always use surgical apply strategy when pushing from this environment.

**6. Licensing & scaling discussion** — David is considering licensing WashRoute to other laundry businesses doing $100K+/month in deliveries. Business model: $10-25K upfront setup fee + 2% of sales (via Stripe Connect application fee). Already has a prospect who asked about licensing "in a few months." Planning to demo the current system within 2 weeks.

**Scaling strategy decided:**
- **Near-term (1-4 clients):** Fork-and-customize approach. Clone the repo per client, rebrand, configure their Stripe/Twilio/Supabase, deploy separately. Manageable with a few clients and generates revenue immediately.
- **At 3-4 clients:** Rebuild as multi-tenant Next.js (React + TypeScript + Tailwind) app on Vercel, keeping Supabase as backend. Shared database with `tenant_id` on every table + RLS isolation. All client-specific customizations become configurable options.
- **Migration path from forks to multi-tenant:** Build new platform in parallel (no downtime risk), migrate one tenant at a time starting with Family Laundry, run old and new side-by-side for validation, then cut over. Estimated ~3 months total (6-8 weeks platform build + 1-2 weeks per client migration).
- **Full multi-tenant rebuild estimate:** 8-12 weeks. Week 1: architecture + tenant config + auth. Week 2: customer app. Weeks 3-4: admin dashboard. Weeks 5-6: driver app + POS + tenant onboarding. Weeks 7-8: data migration + testing.
- **Key technical decisions for v2:** Next.js app router, TypeScript, Tailwind, Supabase stays as backend, Stripe Connect for automated 2% revenue collection, tenant-scoped RLS policies.

**Action items for next sessions:**
- QA pass on all three apps before demo
- S700 reader: register and test when it arrives
- Subscription Phase 2: Stripe integration + signup flow
- Prepare demo environment (clean data, polished UX)

### Apr 13, 2026 (session 108) — Invoice settings, Settings page reorg, customer KPI fix, orders performance, billing fixes, QA

**1. Invoice Settings (configurable invoice header)**
- New `invoice_config` JSONB column on `settings` table (migration: `add_invoice_config_to_settings`).
- `BIZ_INVOICE` global object: `logo_url`, `company_name`, `address_line1`, `address_line2`, `phone`, `email`, `footer`.
- `loadSettings()` hydrates `BIZ_INVOICE` from DB on startup; `saveInvoiceConfig()` persists changes.
- `_preloadInvoiceLogo(url)` re-callable — converts logo to base64 for PDF embedding.
- All 3 invoice renderers (PDF via jsPDF, HTML invoice, per-customer `printInvoice`) now use `BIZ_INVOICE` instead of hardcoded strings.
- Settings page "Invoice" tab: editable fields for all 7 config values + live logo preview.

**2. Settings page reorganization**
- Renamed nav item from "Printer" → "General" (gear icon).
- Settings page now uses tabbed layout: **Invoice | Printer | Reviews** (reuses existing `filter-tabs` CSS pattern).
- Page title fixed from "Timezone" to "General".

**3. Customer KPI accuracy fix**
- **Root cause:** `customers.last_order_at` was only updated when opening the customer panel in admin, not on order creation. Active customer count (7d) was severely underreported (123 vs actual 383).
- **Fix:** New DB trigger `trg_update_customer_last_order_at` on `orders` INSERT — automatically sets `last_order_at` on the customer.
- **Backfill:** One-time UPDATE set `last_order_at = MAX(orders.created_at)` for all customers.
- Migration: `add_trigger_update_customer_last_order_at`.

**4. Orders page performance (lazy-loading)**
- Phase 1: `loadOrders()` now only fetches active statuses (~500 rows) on initial load.
- Phase 2: `_loadDeliveredOrders()` and `_loadOrdersSideFetches()` run in background after render.
- Delivered orders limited to 90-day lookback, capped at 1000 rows.
- Table pagination: `ORDERS_PAGE_SIZE = 100` with "Show More" button.
- Load time improved from 3–4 seconds to <1 second.

**5. Unpaid orders — on_account exclusion**
- `on_account` customers (e.g., Almanac Beer) excluded from unpaid orders list, Issues tab filter, and issue pill count.
- Pattern: `o.customers?.billing_type !== 'on_account'` at 3 code locations.
- Const reassignment crash fixed: changed `const { data }` to `const { data: rawData }` + `const data = rawData.filter(...)`.

**6. Billing balance fix**
- Balance query was filtering `.is('recurring_interval', null).is('stripe_payment_intent_id', null)` — excluded all recurring orders and already-attempted charges.
- Fixed to `.not('billing_status', 'in', '("paid","refunded")')` — canonical unpaid filter.
- 6 of 17 unpaid orders for affected customers were recurring (previously hidden).

**7. Orders KPI sanity check**
- All 6 stat cards verified correct against database queries.
- `updateOrderStatCards()` hardened with null-safe DOM setter `_s(id, v)`.

**8. QA sweep (3 parallel agents)**
- **XSS fix:** `orderSearchTerm` injected raw into innerHTML empty-state message → escaped with `esc()`.
- **XSS fix:** Phone/email in `cp-meta` after saving contact info → escaped with `esc()`.
- **Crash guard:** Background `_loadDeliveredOrders().then()` called `renderOrders()` without checking `currentPage === 'orders'` — would crash if user navigated away.
- **Null safety:** `updateOrderStatCards()` now checks element existence before setting textContent.
- **Stale UI:** `showMoreOrders()` re-renders table (resetting checkboxes) but didn't call `updateOrderBatchBar()`.

**Database migrations:**
- `add_invoice_config_to_settings` — `invoice_config jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{...}'` on settings
- `add_trigger_update_customer_last_order_at` — trigger function on orders INSERT

**Commits:**
- `6b7eec4` Add Invoice Settings to Settings page
- `94df15d` Rename Printer to General, organize settings into tabbed layout
- `3fa2f23` Fix settings page title, rename General tab to Reviews
- `f805805` Paginate orders table to 100 rows with Show More button
- `7b56cd3` Lazy-load delivered orders and side-fetches for faster Orders page
- `209a67e` Exclude on_account customers from unpaid orders and Issues tab
- `7d2277e` Fix unpaid orders crash — const reassignment error
- `d02ca6f` Fix customer billing balance to include recurring and failed-charge orders
- `77170fa` QA fixes: XSS escaping, null safety, background render guard, batch bar sync

**Files touched:**
- `admin-dashboard/index.html` — all changes above

---

### Apr 11, 2026 (session 107) — Customer app UX polish + sign-out fix + Special Care Notes sync

**1. Account Details divider spacing**
- Reduced `.cd-divider` margin from `28px 0` to `19px 0` (one third reduction) for tighter spacing between section buttons and the next field.

**2. Customer app sign-out fixed in browser**
- `handleSignOut()` previously relied on `onAuthStateChange` firing after `db.auth.signOut()` to navigate away. In browser (non-PWA) contexts this event sometimes doesn't fire, leaving the user stuck on the app screen with a frozen "Signing out…" button.
- Fixed: local cleanup (clear state, hide nav, show auth screen) now runs immediately after the `signOut()` call regardless of auth event.

**3. Special Care Notes — two-way sync between order flow and Preferences**
- Notes are stored as `_notes` key inside the existing `customers.preferences` JSON column (no DB migration needed).
- **Order step 3:** textarea pre-fills from `preferences._notes` on first visit; restores typed text if customer goes back and returns to that step.
- **Preferences tab:** "Special Care Notes" textarea added at the bottom of the Laundry Preferences panel. Pre-fills from saved notes when opened. Saved alongside other preference toggles.
- **Order placement:** notes are merged back into `preferences` (as `_notes`) when the order is placed, so they persist for next time automatically.
- **Key implementation note:** Uses `draft.specialInstructions === undefined` to detect "never visited step 3 this session" vs. `null` (explicitly cleared). `mergedPrefs` always starts from `currentCustomer.preferences` so existing pref toggles are never overwritten.

**4. Tip label rename**
- "Add a tip for your driver" → "Add a tip for the team" (order step 4 header)
- "Driver tip" / "Driver tip (X%)" → "Team Tip" / "Team Tip (X%)" (confirm summary row)

**Files touched:**
- `customer-app/index.html` — all changes above

---

### Apr 11, 2026 (session 106) — Split order feature + tip type bug fix + commit.sh

**1. Split order between 2–3 launderers (Processing Queue → Folding panel)**
- New DB table: `order_folding_assignments` (order_id, launderer_id, bags, weight_lbs) with RLS + indexes.
- Fold panel (opened from Cleaning column) now has a "↔ Split between multiple people" toggle below the launderer grid.
- Split mode shows a 2/3 people selector + per-slot launderer dropdowns. Bags and weight divide equally and fractionally (e.g. 1.5 bags · 9.5 lbs each). Same person can't appear twice.
- "✓ Confirm Split" writes to `order_folding_assignments` + sets `folded_by_id` to first person for backward compat.
- Single-person tap flow completely unchanged.
- Fold card shows: `👥 Split: Maria, James (1.5 bags · 9.5 lbs each)`.
- `assignFolderInline` (inline reassign dropdown on fold cards) also clears split rows + local map so card reverts to single-person display.

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
- `folded_by_id` on `orders` remains the "primary" launderer for all existing reports. Full split detail is in `order_folding_assignments`. When building launderer stats/reports, JOIN this table to get per-person fractional bags/weight.
- `foldAssignmentsMap` (order_id → array of assignments) is populated in `loadFolding()` and used by both `renderFoldQueue()` and `renderFoldPanel()`.

**2. Fixed admin tip type bug (pre-existing)**
- `renderFoldPanel()` line checked `default_tip_type === 'percent'` but DB stores `'%'`. Percentage tip defaults showed as dollar amounts in admin's new-order form. Fixed to `=== '%'`.

**3. `commit.sh` helper script**
- Added `commit.sh` to repo root. Clears stale `.git/*.lock` files, stages all three app files, commits, and pushes. Usage: `./commit.sh "message"`. Run `chmod +x commit.sh` once to activate.

**Files touched:**
- `admin-dashboard/index.html` — split feature (all JS), tip type fix
- `commit.sh` — new helper script (committed separately from David's terminal due to sandbox lock issue)

### Apr 10, 2026 (session 105) — Password reset/set feature + old-system data migration

**Context:** Colleague John signed up via phone OTP and discovered there was no way to set a password — the Change Password form requires a current password that never existed. Also migrated customer data (discounts, delivery instructions) from the old Starchup system CSV exports.

**1. Password reset/set feature for customer app (`customer-app/index.html`).**
Three-part solution following industry best practices:

- **"Forgot password?" link** — Added below the Current Password field. Calls `db.auth.resetPasswordForEmail()` with redirect back to `app.familylaundry.com`. Shows toast confirmation.
- **Recovery landing handler** — `onAuthStateChange` intercepts `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` events (from Supabase reset email link). Navigates to Account Details, hides the normal password form, and shows a "Set New Password" form (new password + confirm only, no current password required). Calls `db.auth.updateUser({password})`. Cleans up URL hash after success so recovery doesn't re-trigger on refresh.
- **Passwordless user detection** — `isPasswordlessUser()` checks `currentUser.identities` for `provider === 'email'`. If no email identity exists (phone-only or magic-link-only users), the "Change Password" section is hidden and a "Set a Password" section is shown instead, with a button to trigger the reset email flow. If user has no email on file, the button is disabled with a note to add an email first.

New functions: `sendPasswordResetEmail()`, `saveRecoveryPassword()`, `isPasswordlessUser()`, `renderPasswordSections()`.
`renderPasswordSections()` is called from `loadContactDetails()` so the right section shows every time Account Details opens.

**2. Customer data migration from old system (Starchup CSV exports).**
- **Discount mapping:** Matched customers from Feb/March 2026 order CSVs to Supabase by phone number (last 10 digits). Applied discounts: SENIORDISC → SENIORS (27 customers), NONPROFIT → NON PROFIT (7), EDUCATEDISC → EDUCATORS (3), VETERANDISC → VETERANS (3). LOVELAUNDRY skipped for now.
- **Access instructions migration:** Migrated pickup/delivery instructions from CSVs into `customers.access_instructions` — 470 from February, 75 additional from March. Only filled empty fields (idempotent `WHERE access_instructions IS NULL OR = ''`).
- **New accounts created:** Bobby Carver, Eugene Smith, Joyce Young — all with SENIORS discount pre-applied.

**Files touched:**
- `customer-app/index.html` — Password reset HTML sections + 4 new JS functions + recovery handler in `onAuthStateChange`.

**QA findings:**
- Blast radius clean — admin dashboard already has its own password recovery flow, driver app has no password change form.
- Recovery handler initially skipped normal session loading (would leave `currentProfile` null). Fixed: now runs `_handleCustomerSession` first, then overlays recovery UI after 800ms delay.
- Phone-only users with no email handled gracefully — button disabled with explanatory text.

**3. Tip picker on order confirmation screen (`customer-app/index.html`).**
- Added tip picker UI to Step 4 (confirmation), right above "Place Order" button. Preset buttons: None / $5 / $10 / $15, plus custom input with $ / % toggle.
- Tip shows as a line item in the Pricing summary ("Driver tip" or "Driver tip (15%)") with green accent color, and is included in the Estimated Total.
- `draft.tipAmount` and `draft.tipType` added to order draft object. Pre-filled from `currentCustomer.default_tip` / `default_tip_type` in `startNewOrder()`.
- `placeOrder()` now writes `tip_amount` and `tip_type` to the orders table. Uses `'dollar'`/`'pct'` convention to match admin dashboard.
- After order placement, updates `customers.default_tip` and `default_tip_type` so the next order pre-fills with whatever the customer chose — creating a "sticky tip" that follows their behavior.
- New functions: `renderTipPicker()`, `selectTipPreset()`, `setTipType()`, `onTipCustomInput()`.
- QA caught a value mismatch: initially wrote `'percent'` to `orders.tip_type` but admin uses `'pct'`. Fixed before commit.

**4. Migrated consistent tippers from old system (Jan–Mar 2026 CSVs/XLSX).**
- Analyzed 3 months of old Starchup order exports (Jan CSV, Feb XLSX, Mar XLSX) for the "Tip" column.
- Identified 274 customers who tipped the same non-zero amount across 2+ orders.
- Matched by phone (last 10 digits) to Supabase customers. Updated `default_tip` and `default_tip_type = '$'` only where current value was NULL or 0 (idempotent).
- Result: 119 new customers got their default tip set. Total customers with tips: 1,070 (up from 951).
- Top tippers: Rabun Jones ($50), Michael Figlock ($26), Tiffany Lewis ($25), Iwen W ($25).

**5. Tip adoption baseline (for measuring impact).**
- As of Apr 10: 55 tipped orders out of 1,814 in past 3 weeks = **3% tip rate**, $590 total, $10.73 avg.
- With tip picker now front-and-center + 119 new defaults pre-filled, expect significant increase. Re-check in 2 weeks.

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
1. **LOVELAUNDRY discount** not yet migrated — David explicitly skipped it. Also skipped: BERKREP, LAUNDRYDONE, 20PERCENTOFF, and one-time promo codes.
2. **`isPasswordlessUser()` uses `currentUser.identities`** — this is populated by Supabase auth. If a user sets a password via recovery, their identity list updates to include `provider: 'email'`, so next time they open Account Details they'll see the normal "Change Password" form.
3. **Supabase email templates** must be branded (already done in session 81) — the reset password email uses the Family Laundry template.
4. **`orders.tip_type` uses `'dollar'`/`'pct'`**, NOT `'$'`/`'%'`. The `customers.default_tip_type` uses `'$'`/`'%'`. The customer app translates between them. Pre-existing admin bug: line 13028 checks `=== 'percent'` instead of `=== '%'` when reading customer defaults — percentage tippers show as dollar in admin's new-order form.
5. **Tip picker only appears on one-time orders placed via customer app.** Recurring orders created by admin also have tip fields (already wired). Driver app has no tip UI.

### Apr 10, 2026 (session 104) — Services & POS UI polish + edit-lock toggles + add-row simplification

**Context:** Session 103 switched to Lucide SVG icons but the `lucideIcon()` helper parsed internal library data incorrectly, causing gray circles. David also found the edit/delete buttons too easy to fat-finger, and asked for cleaner UI across Services and POS tabs.

**1. Fixed Lucide icon rendering.**
- The `lucideIcon()` function was manually parsing `lucide.icons` internal data, which didn't match the actual library structure. Rewrote to use official `data-lucide` attributes + `lucide.createIcons()` API.
- Added `refreshLucideIcons()` debounced helper — called after any DOM update that adds new icon elements.
- Fixed CDN URL to `unpkg.com/lucide@latest/dist/umd/lucide.min.js` (UMD build).

**2. Edit-lock toggle for Services tab.**
- Default state: locked — clean read-only rows showing name, price, type (3-column grid via `svcRowLocked()`).
- Unlock button in header reveals full editing controls (inline inputs, type dropdown, active toggle, reorder/delete).
- Add-new-service row hidden when locked, shown when unlocked.
- Same pattern as Merchandise category edit-lock from session 103.

**3. Services tab header simplification.**
- Removed redundant "MAIN SERVICES" header and nested category grouping.
- Flat layout: Price List dropdown (Delivery / Commercial / Add-ons) → filtered service list.
- Edit toggle button height matched to Price List dropdown (`font-size:13px; padding:6px 10px`).

**4. Add-row alignment and simplification (all tabs).**
- **Services tab:** Grid columns aligned to match `svc-row` edit grid. Add button moved to its own right-aligned row. Addon dropdown now auto-assigns from active price list filter (same logic as category).
- **POS Merchandise:** Removed icon input field (defaults to 'package'). Removed category dropdown — auto-assigns from active category filter. Error message if on "All" tab.
- **POS Laundry Services:** (QA blast-radius fix) Same cleanup — removed icon input, fixed broken grid layout, consistent button placement.

**5. Misc cleanup.**
- Hid "Retail" from Price Lists tab (`renderCategoryManager()` filters it out).
- Reordered tabs: Services, Price Lists, App Display, Fees, Preferences, Point of Sale.
- `saveNewService()` auto-assigns `pricelist` from `svc-cat-filter` value.

**Files touched:**
- `admin-dashboard/index.html` — ~15 edits across CSS, HTML, and JS.
- `pos-mockup.html` — Lucide CDN fix + `lucideIcon()` rewrite.

**QA blast-radius findings:**
- Base `.svc-add-row` CSS change (4-col grid) broke POS Laundry Services add-row (had 6 children without inline grid override). Fixed by adding explicit inline grid-template-columns.
- All `nm-icon`, `nrs-icon` DOM references cleaned from both HTML and JS.
- No security issues, no sensitive data logging, all inputs use parameterized Supabase queries.

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
1. **`lucideIcon()` now uses `data-lucide` attributes.** After any DOM update that inserts icon elements, call `refreshLucideIcons()` to activate them.
2. **Add-rows auto-assign category/pricelist from active filter.** If user is on "All" view, they get a toast prompting them to select a category first.
3. **David's feedback: "Spend more time on UI details."** Alignment, consistent heights, grid column matching — these matter. Check add-rows against their parent table grids before committing.

**6. Fixed expired-session RLS error on customer order placement.**
- **Customer report:** Nicole Pena (Berkeley Rep) got "new row violates row-level security policy for orders" when placing an order. Root cause: her JWT expired while the browser tab was in the background. The app showed her as logged in (from localStorage cache), but `auth.uid()` returned null server-side → RLS correctly blocked the INSERT.
- **Three-layer fix in `customer-app/index.html`:**
  1. Pre-flight `db.auth.getSession()` check right before the order INSERT. If session is dead → "session expired" toast → redirect to sign-in.
  2. RLS-specific error catch: if the RLS error still slips through, catches `row-level security` in the error message and shows the friendly "session expired" message instead of raw DB jargon.
  3. Background session validation on cache-load startup: when `_handleCustomerSession` loads from `loadUserCache()`, it immediately calls `db.auth.getSession()` and signs out if the session is dead — so users can't navigate with a stale session.
- **Config change:** Supabase JWT access token expiry increased from 3600s (1 hour) to 86400s (24 hours) via Dashboard → Settings → JWT Keys → Access token expiry time. This gives a much larger buffer before a sleeping tab's token expires.
- **Nicole's data is fine** — auth user, profile, and customer record all correctly linked. She just needs to refresh the page and sign in again.

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
4. **Expired sessions now handled gracefully**, but the root cause (browser suspending tabs and killing refresh timers) can't be fully prevented client-side. The 3-layer fix ensures users always get a clear "session expired" message instead of cryptic RLS errors.
5. **JWT expiry is now 24 hours.** If this needs to be changed, it's under Supabase Dashboard → Settings → JWT Keys → Legacy JWT Secret tab → Access token expiry time.

### Apr 10, 2026 (session 103) — Replace emojis with Lucide SVG icons + editable merchandise categories

**Context:** Session 102 added the merchandise table and POS admin tab with emoji-based icons. David said emojis "drive him crazy" and asked for real SVG icons. Also wanted merchandise category names to be editable and deletable.

**1. Database migration: `rename_emoji_to_icon_and_seed_lucide_names`.**
- Renamed `emoji` column → `icon` on both `services` and `merchandise` tables.
- Seeded all rows with Lucide icon names (kebab-case): `shirt`, `waves`, `wind`, `bed-double`, `zap`, `sparkles`, `droplet`, `refresh-cw` for services; `cup-soda`, `coffee`, `glass-water`, `candy`, `cookie`, `package`, `droplets`, `flask-conical`, `flower-2`, `file-text`, `spray-can`, `shopping-bag` for merchandise.

**2. Lucide CDN + icon helper function in both apps.**
- Added `<script src="https://unpkg.com/lucide@latest"></script>` to both `pos-mockup.html` and `admin-dashboard/index.html`.
- Created `lucideIcon(name, size)` helper that converts kebab-case icon names to PascalCase, looks up the icon in `lucide.icons`, and returns an inline SVG string. Falls back to `Package` icon if not found.

**3. POS app (pos-mockup.html) — all emoji references replaced.**
- CSS: `.tile-emoji` → `.tile-icon`, `.cart-empty-emoji` → `.cart-empty-icon`, `.addon-chip-emoji` → `.addon-chip-icon`, `.tab-emoji` → `.tab-icon`.
- Tile rendering uses `lucideIcon(s.icon)` instead of `s.emoji`.
- Cart item names, addon pills, addon chips all use `lucideIcon()`.
- Supabase queries select `icon` instead of `emoji`.
- `dbRowToTile()` maps `row.icon` instead of `row.emoji`.
- Order line items payload uses `icon` field instead of `emoji`.
- Static HTML icons (tab bar, empty cart) use `data-lucide` attributes + `lucide.createIcons()` on init.

**4. Admin dashboard — emoji inputs replaced with icon-name inputs.**
- `#nrs-emoji` input → `#nrs-icon` (placeholder: "shirt", width: 80px).
- `#nm-emoji` input → `#nm-icon` (placeholder: "package", width: 80px).
- `renderRetailServices()` and `renderMerchandise()` use `lucideIcon()` instead of emoji text.
- `saveNewRetailSvc()` and `saveNewMerch()` save `icon` field instead of `emoji`.
- Trash-can emojis (🗑) replaced with `lucideIcon('trash-2', 16)`.
- CSS: `.merch-emoji` → `.merch-icon`.

**5. Merchandise category rename and delete.**
- Each category pill in the filter bar now has pencil (rename) and X (delete) icon buttons.
- `renameMerchCategory(oldName)` — prompts for new name, updates all merchandise in that category via `UPDATE merchandise SET category = newName WHERE category = oldName`.
- `deleteMerchCategory(catName)` — confirms with product count, deletes all merchandise in the category from DB, removes from local state.

**Files touched:**
- `pos-mockup.html` — ~30 edits (Lucide CDN, icon helper, all emoji→icon replacements).
- `admin-dashboard/index.html` — ~30 edits (Lucide CDN, icon helper, emoji→icon replacements, category edit/delete).
- `PROJECT-NOTES.md` — this entry.

**DB changes:**
- Migration: `rename_emoji_to_icon_and_seed_lucide_names` (column rename + data seed).

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
1. **Lucide icon names are kebab-case strings** stored in the `icon` column. The `lucideIcon()` helper converts to PascalCase for lookup. When adding new services or merchandise, use valid Lucide icon names from https://lucide.dev/icons.
2. **Other emojis remain in the codebase** — order status icons (🧺, 📦), queue badge, notification text, etc. These are UI decorations, not from the database. Replace them if desired in a future session.
3. **Session 101 "future sessions" items #2 and #4 are now resolved** (merchandise table + cash numpad, done in session 102).

---

### Apr 10, 2026 (session 102) — Cash numpad + merchandise table + POS admin tab

**Context:** Follow-up to session 101. Built three features: cash amount-tendered numpad with change calculation, a `merchandise` database table to replace hardcoded drinks/snacks/supplies, and a "Point of Sale" admin tab in Services & Pricing.

**1. Cash numpad modal.**
- New `#cashModal` with 10-key numpad, quick-amount buttons ($5, $10, $20, $50, $100, Exact), and real-time change calculation display.
- Functions: `payWithCash()`, `cashKey()`, `cashQuickAmount()`, `cashExact()`, `renderCashDisplay()`, `closeCashModal()`, `cashCompleteSale()`.
- Success screen shows change due via `#successChange` element.

**2. Merchandise database table (migration: `create_merchandise_table`).**
- New `merchandise` table: `id UUID`, `name TEXT`, `emoji TEXT` (later renamed to `icon` in session 103), `category TEXT`, `price NUMERIC`, `is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true`, `sort_order INTEGER`, `created_at TIMESTAMPTZ`.
- RLS: anon read access, admin-only writes via `is_admin()`.
- Seeded 24 products across 3 categories: Drinks (8), Snacks (8), Supplies (8).
- POS app loads merchandise from DB, builds dynamic tab buttons per category.

**3. POS admin tab in Services & Pricing.**
- Added "Point of Sale" tab to the existing tab bar in Services & Pricing (not a sidebar nav item).
- Two sub-tabs: "Laundry Services" and "Merchandise".
- **Laundry Services sub-tab**: Editable inline name/price, active toggle, delete button, add-new row. Source of truth for Retail services (replaces the old Retail pricelist view).
- **Merchandise sub-tab**: Dynamic category filter pills, editable product rows, add-new row with category dropdown, "+ Category" button for creating new categories.
- Renamed "Categories" tab → "Price Lists" and added "Price List" label above the dropdown.
- Hid Retail from the pricelist dropdown (it's managed in the POS tab now).

**Files touched:**
- `pos-mockup.html` — cash numpad modal + dynamic merchandise loading.
- `admin-dashboard/index.html` — POS tab, sub-tabs, all CRUD functions.

**DB changes:**
- Migration: `create_merchandise_table` (new table + RLS + seed data).

---

### Apr 10, 2026 (session 101) — POS wired to Supabase: live services, order creation, walk-in queue

**Context:** Session 100 left the POS mockup as a design-only prototype with hardcoded data. This session wired it to the real Supabase database — the POS now creates actual orders, loads real service prices, and has a queue for managing walk-in laundry through the processing pipeline.

**1. Supabase client + Retail pricelist (migration: `add_retail_pricelist_and_emoji_to_services`).**
- Added `emoji TEXT` column to the `services` table.
- Added CHECK constraint on `pricelist` allowing 'Delivery', 'Commercial', 'Retail'.
- Seeded 9 Retail service rows: Wash & Fold ($2.50/lb), Wash & Dry ($1.75/lb), Dry Only ($1.00/lb), Comforter ($18/ea), Hang Dry ($4.00/lb), Rush ($10/ea), Oxi ($3 flat addon), Vinegar ($3 flat addon), Double Wash ($5 flat addon).
- Data fix: 3 addon rows had `pricing_type='per_lb'` but are flat per-drop-off charges — corrected to `per_item`.
- POS loads `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js@2">` + initializes `db` client with anon key. Services tab and weight-modal add-ons now fetch from `services WHERE pricelist='Retail' AND is_active=true` on page load. Drinks/snacks/supplies remain hardcoded (merchandise table TBD).

**2. Admin sign-in for customer lookup.**
- Added a 🔒 **Sign in** pill in the topbar. Opens a login modal using `db.auth.signInWithPassword()`. Session persists via `storageKey: 'washroute-pos-auth'`.
- When signed in: customer phone lookup queries `customers` table (admin RLS via `is_admin()`). Phone normalization strips all non-digits and compares last 10 digits (handles E.164, formatted, bare).
- When not signed in: falls back to a single hardcoded demo customer (510-608-5446 → David Hernandez) so the mockup is still demoable.
- Pill turns green when signed in, shows email prefix. Click to sign out.

**3. Order creation (Charge → real `orders` row).**
- `createPosOrder({ paymentMethod })` builds a full order payload:
  - `source = 'walk_in'`, no pickup/delivery windows, no route stops.
  - `status = 'processing'` if cart has any laundry service; `'delivered'` if merchandise-only.
  - `line_items` JSONB carries each service line with real UUID `service_id`, weight, qty, addons, and a final tax row.
  - `paid_at`, `billed_at`, `billing_status='paid'`, `billing_payment_method='cash'|'card'` — POS transactions are paid at time of sale.
- Cash button calls `chargeAndFinish('cash')` → creates order → shows success screen with real order number (e.g. `Order #2131`).
- Card button opens the existing terminal animation; "Simulate success" creates the order as card payment. Real Stripe Terminal integration is a future session.
- Guard: refuses to charge unless admin is signed in (RLS would reject anyway, but the error is shown inline instead of a cryptic Postgres message).
- Double-tap protection: buttons disable while insert is in-flight.

**4. Walk-in queue panel.**
- **📦 badge** in the topbar shows count of walk-in orders in `processing` or `ready_for_delivery` status. Amber highlight when items are in the queue.
- Tapping the badge slides a queue panel over the cart area. Two sections:
  - 🧼 **Washing** — orders in `processing`. Each card shows customer name (or "Walk-in"), order number, service summary from `line_items`, time-ago. Green "Mark Ready" button → advances to `ready_for_delivery`.
  - ✅ **Ready for Pickup** — orders awaiting customer return. Purple "Mark Picked Up" button → stamps `actual_delivery_at` and moves to `delivered`.
- Auto-refreshes every 30s (count-only when panel closed, full refresh when open). Also refreshes immediately after every POS sale.
- "← Back to cart" returns to normal register view.

**5. Weight modal compact layout.**
- The "Cancel" / "Add to cart" buttons were off-screen (scrolled below the fold). Moved them to a pinned `.modal-footer` outside the scrollable `.modal-body`.
- Compressed numpad display (48→34px weight font), key sizes (18→12px padding), add-on chips (smaller padding/fonts), and modal header/footer padding so the entire modal — numpad, add-ons, and action buttons — fits without scrolling.

**6. Profile fix: `david@familylaundry.com` role changed from `driver` → `admin`.** This account had `role='driver'` (probably from testing the driver app). `is_admin()` only allows `admin`/`manager`/`laundry_tech`, so POS order creation was failing with "new row violates row-level security policy for table orders". Fixed via `UPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin'`.

**7. Flow picker hardened for DB-sourced IDs.** The demo flow picker (showFlow) previously referenced hardcoded short IDs like `'oxi'` and `'vinegar'`. Now uses `WEIGHT_ADDONS.find(a => /oxi/i.test(a.name))` to look up by name, which works with both the old short IDs and the new UUIDs from the database.

**Trigger safety audit for walk-in orders:**
- `auto_route_on_insert` — only fires when `status='scheduled' AND pickup_run_id IS NULL`. POS inserts with `status='processing'` → trigger is a no-op. ✅
- `log_order_created` — writes an `order_events` entry. Actor resolves to 'Customer' for `source='walk_in'` (minor — not blocking). ✅
- `trg_create_recurring_order_fn` — only fires on delivered/skipped/pickup_failed UPDATE. No-op on INSERT. ✅
- All UPDATE triggers (stop sync, reschedule, etc.) — irrelevant on INSERT. ✅

**End-to-end test (then deleted):** Inserted a test order (#2130) directly via SQL with the exact POS payload shape. Verified: 0 route_stops, 1 order_event ('created'), no routing_error, 3 line_items. Deleted after verification.

**Files touched:**
- `pos-mockup.html` — 983 insertions, 96 deletions (Supabase wiring, admin auth, order creation, queue panel, layout fixes).
- `PROJECT-NOTES.md` — this entry.

**DB changes:**
- Migration: `add_retail_pricelist_and_emoji_to_services` (emoji column, pricelist CHECK, 9 Retail rows).
- Data fix: 3 addon rows `pricing_type` corrected from `per_lb` to `per_item`.
- Profile fix: `david@familylaundry.com` role `driver` → `admin`.

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
1. **POS is now live-data but not production-deployed.** `pos-mockup.html` creates real orders in the production Supabase database. It's still a standalone file opened locally — not deployed to Vercel. Treat orders from it as real.
2. **~~Merchandise (drinks/snacks/supplies) is still hardcoded.~~** ✅ Resolved session 102 — `merchandise` table created, POS loads from DB, admin dashboard has Merchandise sub-tab.
3. **Card payment is stubbed.** The terminal modal's "Simulate success" creates a real order with `billing_payment_method='card'` but no actual Stripe charge. Wiring Stripe Terminal is its own session.
4. **~~Cash payment has no change calculator.~~** ✅ Resolved session 102 — cash numpad with quick-amount buttons and change calculation.
5. **log_order_created actor for walk-in orders.** The trigger sets `actor_name='Customer'` for `source='walk_in'`. Would be more accurate as `'POS'` or the signed-in admin's name. Minor — not blocking.
6. **Queue shows all walk-in orders, not just today's.** If old walk-in orders are left in `processing` or `ready_for_delivery` status, they'll appear in the queue. The daily audit should catch these as stale.
7. **Session 100's "future sessions" note #1 is now resolved.** The POS is no longer design-only. Note #2 (add-on catalog from DB) is resolved. Note #4 (Retail pricelist) is resolved. Notes #3 (flat pricing assumption) and #5 (sober aesthetic baseline) still apply.

### Apr 9, 2026 (session 100) — POS mockup: add-ons, tile shrink, sober aesthetic

**Context:** Continued the POS mockup work started in session ~95 on Apr 8. Goal for this session was "UI first — get it looking right." Scope was explicitly design-only on the single-file mockup `pos-mockup.html` at the repo root (not wired to Supabase yet, not in production). David flagged three things over the course of the session.

**1. Wash add-ons (Oxi, Vinegar, Double Wash).** David's open question from the prior session was "how do we charge add-ons like Oxi and/or vinegar?" After walking through the options, we decided:
- Add-ons live **inside the weight modal**, right below the numpad — one modal, one decision, no extra screen.
- **Flat per-drop-off** pricing (not per-pound), matching how they're invoiced today: ✨ Oxi $3, 💧 Vinegar $3, 🔄 Double Wash $5.
- Add-ons are per-service-line: they attach to the specific W&F or W&D batch the cashier is weighing, so a customer can ask for Oxi on whites only while a second W&F line stays plain.
- Implemented as toggleable chips in a 3-column grid. Active state shows a purple check badge + accent-light fill. The weight modal's calculation line now shows `base + add-ons = total` when any add-on is active.
- Cart lines render small purple pill badges under each add-on-enabled line (`✨ Oxi +3.00` etc).
- A `WEIGHT_ADDONS` catalog constant at the top of the JS makes it trivial to extend later (starch, scent boost, bleach, whatever). `addToCart()` now accepts an `addons` array; `lineTotal()` sums base price × weight + flat add-on total.
- New flow-picker scenario "Weight + add-ons" opens the weight modal pre-populated with 14.5 lb and Oxi+Vinegar selected, so the whole thing demos in one click.

**2. Cut tile heights in half.** The product/service tiles (Wash & Fold, Drinks, etc.) were unnecessarily tall. `.tile` `min-height` dropped from 120 → 72px, padding 16/14 → 10/12, gap 8 → 3, emoji 30 → 22, name 14 → 13 with `flex: 1` removed so the tile only takes its content height. **First attempt didn't visibly change anything** — the root cause was that `.tile-grid` had `flex: 1` filling the vertical product panel and, with no `grid-auto-rows`, the grid rows stretched to fill that extra space regardless of `min-height` on the tiles. Fix: added `grid-auto-rows: min-content; align-content: start` to `.tile-grid`. Tiles now pack at the top and only take their own height.

**3. "Replace the purple buttons with white + black outline — sober, clean."** David pointed at the admin processing queue kanban column headers as the target aesthetic. Three places were affected:
- **`.flow-btn`** (the scenario/flow picker at the top of the mockup page) — `.flow-btn.active` was `var(--accent)` purple. Changed to white background + `1.5px solid var(--gray-200)`, active flips to `--gray-900` fill with white text.
- **`.tile.service`** (the laundry service tiles — W&F, W&D, Dry Only, Comforter, Hang Dry, Rush) — had a purple linear gradient (`#ede9fe → #f5f3ff`) with a lavender border. Now white with `var(--gray-200)` border.
- **`.tile-price`** (all tile price labels) — was `color: var(--accent-dark)` globally, making every price purple. Now `var(--gray-900)`.
- **`.tile:hover`** glow — was purple (`rgba(99,91,255,0.12)`). Now neutral `rgba(0,0,0,0.06)` with a `--gray-400` border.

The product-category tabs (`.tab`) at the top of the products panel were already in the target style — white with gray outline, dark fill on active — so no change needed there.

**Design note added to the mockup** (rendered below the device, alongside the existing "Scale & weight" and "Receipt" notes) explaining the add-on rationale: where they live, how they're priced, and why they're attached to the specific service line instead of the cart total.

**Files touched:**
- `pos-mockup.html` — **this file was previously untracked** (the whole mockup was started in session ~95 on Apr 8 but never committed). This commit adds the entire file, including all of today's session-100 work, to git for the first time.
- `PROJECT-NOTES.md` — this entry.

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
1. **POS is design-only right now.** `pos-mockup.html` is a self-contained HTML demo with fake `SERVICES`, `FAKE_CUSTOMERS`, and flow-picker buttons. It has zero Supabase wiring, no auth, no order insertion. Treat it as a Figma substitute, not a feature branch. When we eventually wire it up, the add-on model needs a corresponding DB shape decision (a JSON column on `order_items` vs a dedicated `order_item_addons` table — TBD).
2. **The add-on catalog is hardcoded in JS** as `WEIGHT_ADDONS`. When this goes live, it should come from a `pos_addons` table or a `settings` row so cashiers can add/remove items without a code push.
3. **Flat-per-drop-off pricing assumption.** If any add-on ever needs to be per-pound (e.g. a premium soap priced per lb), `lineTotal()` needs to accept a per-addon `priceType` field. Right now every add-on is flat.
4. **Retail POS pricing tier is still TBD.** See the `pricelist` rename notes from session 97p3 — POS walk-in transactions should pull from a third pricelist (`retail`) tied to the transaction channel, not the customer profile. Not blocking, but worth revisiting when wiring this up.
5. **Sober aesthetic is the new baseline.** If anything new is added to the POS mockup, match the white + gray-200 outline + dark fill pattern instead of using `--accent` as a fill. Accent is still fine for small hits (active chip check badges, cart add-on pills, the `POS — CASHIER TERMINAL` screen label), just not for large filled buttons.

### Apr 15, 2026 (session 115) — Subscription overage auto-billing

**Context:** Phase 4 of subscriptions. Usage deduction and overage calculation was wired in session 114, but nothing actually *billed* the overage — `overage_amount_due` was computed but sat in the DB indefinitely.

**The fix — `stripe-webhook` v30 with `invoice.created` handler:**

When Stripe creates a renewal invoice (fires ~1 hour before the period ends while the invoice is still in `draft` status), the webhook checks whether the subscriber has `overage_amount_due > 0`. If so, it creates a Stripe `invoice_item` attached to that draft invoice — the customer's next monthly charge = base plan fee + overage.

Key details:
- **Idempotency:** key `overage-${subscription_id}-${invoice_id}` prevents double-billing on webhook retries.
- **Metadata:** item is tagged `washroute_overage: true` + `washroute_subscription_id` so reports and downstream handlers can identify it.
- **Audit trail:** appends an `overage_invoiced` event to `subscription_usage_log` with the dollar amount and Stripe invoice ID.
- **Guard:** only acts on `draft` invoices. If Stripe delivers the webhook after the invoice finalizes (unlikely but possible), it skips gracefully.
- **Period reset (existing):** `trg_reset_subscription_usage` (session 114) already zeroes `overage_amount_due` when `current_period_end` moves forward (happens on `invoice.payment_succeeded`), so the next cycle starts fresh.

**Audit Check #15 added** to `washroute-audit.skill`: flags subscriptions with `overage_amount_due > 0` whose `current_period_end` is more than 3 days past — indicates an overage that should have been invoiced but wasn't (missed webhook, wrong Stripe event config, failed payment).

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Stripe Dashboard config step required.** The webhook endpoint must be subscribed to the `invoice.created` event type. If it's not already in the list (Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → your endpoint → select events), add it. Without this, the `invoice.created` handler will never fire and overages won't get attached.

**Files/functions touched:**
- `stripe-webhook` edge fn v30 deployed (added `invoice.created` handler, ~45 LOC).
- `washroute-audit.skill` rebuilt with Check #15 (stale overage).

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
1. **Edge case — missed draft window.** If the webhook processes late (after the ~1h draft window closes), the overage line item can't be attached and the customer pays only the base fee. The overage stays in `overage_amount_due` and should be caught by Check #15 at the next audit. Resolution: manually invoice or write off. Not automatable without Stripe's `invoice.upcoming` event (2-day advance notice) — consider subscribing to that too as a fallback.
2. **Overage-only invoicing.** Currently only fires at period renewal. If a subscriber cancels mid-cycle with overage owed, it won't be billed (no next invoice). Phase 5: generate a final invoice on `customer.subscription.deleted` with any outstanding overage.

---

### Apr 15, 2026 (session 114) — POS polish + Subscriptions end-to-end

**Context:** Stripe Terminal S700 arrives tomorrow; subscriptions DB schema was already in place but the signup flow, usage enforcement, and admin management were unfinished.

**Track 1 — POS polish (`pos-mockup.html`, `stripe-terminal` edge fn v2):**

1. **Receipt buttons wired** in the success modal. Print → `print_jobs` insert (Star Document Markup for mC-Print3 CloudPRNT) with browser popup fallback when no printer token is configured. Email → `send-receipt` edge function. Text → `send-sms` with a short "Order #X · $Y · Thank you!" body. Email/Text buttons hide automatically for walk-ins with no attached customer. Each button shows a ✓ Sent / ✓ Emailed / ✓ Printed confirmation.
2. **Customer lookup extended** to pull `id, email_cache` so the attached-customer object on the cart has everything needed for email/text receipts without a second round-trip. `attachCustomer` now takes an optional `extras` object; new `attachCustomerById` lookups keyed through `_customerLookupCache`.
3. **`stripe-terminal` edge fn v2** — idempotency key on PaymentIntent creation (deterministic per-sale key generated client-side, regenerated on fresh sale or hard payment failure — prevents duplicate charges if the cashier's retry races a network drop). 25-second timeout wrapper on every Stripe call so a hung API doesn't lock the register. Upper-cap $5,000 guard to prevent typo-driven huge charges. Structured error response shape `{error, code, details?}` so the POS client can distinguish retry-safe vs hard-fail.
4. **5-second auto-advance** on the success modal — cashier doesn't need to tap "Start new sale" after a successful transaction. Any receipt-button click cancels the timer so the cashier has time to print/email/text before the reset.

**Track 2 — Subscriptions Phase 1 (signup + create):**

5. **`create-checkout` already supported `type: 'subscription'`** (session 109) — no new edge function needed. It opens Stripe Checkout in `mode: 'subscription'` and the existing `stripe-webhook` handler populates the `subscriptions` row on `customer.subscription.created`.
6. **Customer app "My Plan" menu item is always visible** now (previously hidden until the customer had an active sub, which made the Subscribe flow undiscoverable). Non-subscribers see a sub-label "Not subscribed · tap to browse plans"; the panel itself shows the plan cards + Subscribe CTAs. Subscribers see their plan name + status.
7. **Admin "Assign Subscription" section** on the customer profile → Billing tab. New card between Billing group and Discount. If no active sub: plan dropdown + "Start Checkout" button that calls `create-checkout` with `customerId` and opens the Stripe-hosted checkout in a new tab — admin can hand the iPad to the customer or email them the link. If active sub: shows plan name, status badge, usage bar, pickup count, overage due, renewal date, plus row action buttons (Phase 3).

**Track 3 — Subscriptions Phase 2 (usage enforcement):**

8. **Migration `subscription_usage_triggers_phase2`** — two new triggers + functions, both `SECURITY DEFINER`:
   - `trg_apply_subscription_usage` on `orders` (BEFORE UPDATE OF status) — when `status` transitions into `delivered` and `subscription_id IS NOT NULL`, deducts `weight_lbs` from `subscriptions.usage_lbs_this_period`, increments `pickups_this_period`, recomputes `overage_amount_due = MAX(0, (usage - weight_limit_lbs) × overage_price_per_lb)`, appends an `order_delivered` event to `subscription_usage_log`, and marks the order `billing_status='paid', billing_payment_method='subscription'` so charge-order won't double-bill. Transition-guarded so re-saves don't re-fire.
   - `trg_reset_subscription_usage` on `subscriptions` (BEFORE UPDATE OF current_period_end) — when `current_period_end` moves forward (happens on `invoice.payment_succeeded` webhook), zeros `usage_lbs_this_period / pickups_this_period / overage_amount_due` and logs a `period_reset` event with the old values for audit.
9. **`charge-order` v35** — defense in depth: if `order.subscription_id IS NOT NULL`, returns `{ success: true, coveredBySubscription: true }` without charging. Trigger already marks these orders paid at delivery time; this is a belt-and-suspenders guard for manual admin clicks or edge-function races.

**Track 4 — Subscriptions Phase 3 (admin actions):**

10. **Customer profile action buttons wired.** `renderCpSubscriptionActions` now renders a context-aware row of Pause/Resume (mutually exclusive based on status), Cancel, and Adjust Usage. The first three call existing edge functions (`pause-subscription`, `resume-subscription`, `cancel-subscription`). Confirm prompts on each. On success, the subscription section + Reports tab (if open) both re-render via `renderCpSubscription()` / `renderSubscriptionsTab()`.
11. **Adjust Usage** is a manual override for edge cases (printer jammed at the store, order re-weighed after delivery, etc.). Prompts for new lbs + new pickups + reason. Recomputes overage from plan limits. Writes to `subscriptions` + appends an `adjustment` row to `subscription_usage_log` with the delta and reason for audit.
12. **Reports → Subscriptions tab** gained an Actions column + click-through: clicking any row (or the Manage → button) opens the customer's profile directly to the Billing tab where the row actions live. Table colspan bumped from 8 → 9.

**Files touched:**
- `pos-mockup.html` — 240+ line additions for receipt handlers, idempotency key, auto-advance, print helpers.
- `customer-app/index.html` — My Plan menu item made always visible + smart sub-label.
- `admin-dashboard/index.html` — customer profile Subscription section (~180 LOC), row-action handlers, Reports table click-through, colspan fix.

**Edge functions:**
- `stripe-terminal` v2 deployed (idempotency + timeout + structured errors + upper-cap).
- `charge-order` v35 deployed (subscription-covered short-circuit).

**DB changes:**
- Migration `subscription_usage_triggers_phase2` — 2 functions + 2 triggers. All `SECURITY DEFINER`. Reversible with `DROP TRIGGER` + `DROP FUNCTION`.

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
1. **Overage auto-billing is not wired.** The trigger computes and stores `overage_amount_due` on the subscription, but nothing charges it automatically. Phase 4: at period-end (in `stripe-webhook` → `invoice.payment_succeeded`), add an `invoice_item` on the Stripe customer for the overage before the invoice is finalized. Then reset the counter on the same event.
2. **Subscription order creation is not automated.** A subscriber still has to book pickups manually through the customer app. Phase 5 could auto-create recurring orders on the `preferred_pickup_day` / `preferred_pickup_window` stored on the subscription. The existing recurring-order trigger (`trg_create_recurring_order_fn`) handles the cascade once the first order is created — but Phase 5 needs the initial order generator.
3. **POS S700 needs hardware registration.** When the reader arrives (Thursday), log in to Stripe Dashboard → Terminal → Readers → register the S700 serial. Then the `discoverAndConnect()` flow in `pos-mockup.html` should find it on first try. The reader code still references "M2" in the UI copy (line 3127, 3137) — harmless but worth updating to "S700" once hardware works.
4. **POS order print_jobs contract vs admin's.** POS uses a minimal Star Markup (header/customer/line items/total/footer) while admin uses the full `buildStarMarkup` with bag info, routes, weight. If you later want them identical, move the markup builder into a shared helper file or expose `send-receipt` to accept a `print: true` flag.
5. **Custom usage adjustment doesn't scale.** The `adminAdjustUsage` prompt flow is quick & dirty (three `prompt()` dialogs). If this gets used often, replace with a proper modal. But the underlying DB writes are sound and auditable via `subscription_usage_log`.

### Apr 15, 2026 (session 113) — Delivery window / route template desync fix + audit Check #14

**Context:** Morning audit flagged two orders (#1473 Chris Whittington, #1514 Courtney Burris) as `delivery_orphaned`. On inspection their admin-panel display showed "4/15 · 7:0–9:0a" delivery windows even though they'd been picked up the night before on PM routes. Tracing the database revealed the order's stored `delivery_window_start` was 4/15 07:00 AM while the actual delivery `route_stop` lived on Berkeley PM / Oakland PM (18:00–22:00). 153 active orders in total had this same desync.

**Three bugs stacked:**

1. **Starchup-imported parent orders** (e.g. #478, #505) were seeded with `delivery_window = pickup_window + 13h`, producing PM-pickup → next-day-AM-delivery combos that didn't match any real route template.
2. **`trg_create_recurring_order_fn` propagated that bad arithmetic forever** via `next_delivery = next_pickup + (old_delivery - old_pickup)`. Every biweekly/weekly child inherited the 13h delta regardless of business reality.
3. **`auto_route_order`'s PM-bridging block** (Apr 8, 2026) detected the "PM pickup + AM delivery" combo and silently routed the delivery stop to a PM template in the same zone — but only updated `v_delivery_time` locally. The order's `delivery_window_start` column was never synced, so every UI that rendered that column (admin panel, customer app, SMS templates) displayed the phantom AM time while the driver actually delivered in PM.

**The fix:**

- **Migration — `auto_route_order` v2 (commit of `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` on 2026-04-15):** After the function successfully places a delivery stop on a route, it now writes the chosen template's `window_start/window_end` on the chosen `run_date` back to the order's `delivery_window_start/end`. This closes the structural hole for all future orders — new, recurring, or rescheduled.
- **Bulk data resync — 153 orders:** UPDATE of `delivery_window_start/end` to match each order's currently-assigned delivery route template on its current `run_date`. `trg_sync_delivery_stop_on_window_change` was temporarily disabled during the UPDATE (the stops are already on the correct routes; we didn't want the trigger trying to relocate them as a side effect of the window change). Snapshot preserved in `_resync_delivery_window_20260415` for rollback/audit.
- **Stale `delivery_orphaned` flags** cleared on the 153 orders. The `flag-delivery-orphaned` cron (every 15 min) will re-set accurately against the corrected windows.

**Audit Check #14 added** (patch saved as `audit-check-14-patch.md` in repo root to merge into `washroute-audit/SKILL.md`): surfaces any delivery window / route template mismatch going forward.

**Did NOT touch:**
- `trg_create_recurring_order_fn` — Migration A on `auto_route_order` catches any bad windows at insert time and rewrites them, so the recurring trigger's arithmetic becomes harmless. Nulling delivery_window in recurring children would have broken the PM-bridging path (which needs a stored AM time to trigger). Left as-is.

**Verification:**
- 0 orders now show a delivery_window / route mismatch.
- Both original flagged orders (Chris + Courtney) now display delivery 4/15 18:00–22:00 on Berkeley PM / Oakland PM — will deliver tonight as operationally expected.

**Correction (same session):** First pass of the delivery resync used an over-strict criterion (`time = template.window_start`) and widened 106 legitimate customer sub-windows (e.g. a 7–9 PM slot inside a 6–10 PM Oakland PM route) to the full template window. Caught when running the pickup-side check, which would have falsely flagged 88 legitimate sub-windows. Restored the 106 sub-window values from the `_resync_delivery_window_20260415` snapshot where the old time was within the template's range AND the old date matched `run_date`. Only 47 delivery rows (truly outside template) remain resynced. Pickup side: 2 genuinely-wrong rows (#2451 San Francisco, #2139 Hayward PM — both had `pickup_window_start` one hour before the earliest route slot) were shifted to the template's `window_start`. Pickup snapshot preserved in `_resync_pickup_window_20260415`.

**Revised Check #14** uses *sub-window alignment* semantics: a window is valid if it (a) falls within the template's window range, (b) lands on the same date as `run_date`, AND (c) aligns to a real sub-window boundary (`template.window_start + N × arrival_window_hours`). Oakland PM (6–10 PM, 2h arrival) has exactly two valid slots: 6–8 PM and 8–10 PM. Any stored time like 7 PM or 9 PM is misaligned. Three such rows were found after the initial fix pass (#2458 Oakland PM delivery @19:00, #1799 Hayward PM delivery @20:00, #2510 Hayward PM pickup @20:00) and snapped to the nearest valid sub-window start. See updated `audit-check-14-patch.md` in repo root.

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
1. The `_resync_delivery_window_20260415` and `_resync_pickup_window_20260415` snapshot tables can be dropped in a week or two once we're confident no rollback is needed.
2. Audit Check #14 needs to be manually pasted into the washroute-audit skill file on David's host (see `audit-check-14-patch.md`). The Cowork mount of the skills folder is read-only.
3. The corrected Check #14 is the source of truth — the initial over-strict version is superseded.

### Apr 9, 2026 (session 99) — Order Recall feature (delivered → back on a route, no SMS)

**Context:** David flagged a recurring operational pain point: "occasionally a driver will mistakenly deliver an order, or wish to add comments to an order, and ask management to place the order back on the route. This happens at least once a day. As of right now this is impossible: once delivered, the order disappears from the Order list, and cannot be edited (or placed back into an 'active' status) from the customer profile."

**The fix — three parts:**

1. **Delivered orders are now findable in search.** `getFilteredOrders()` no longer excludes delivered/cancelled/failed orders from search results. The `INACTIVE_STATUSES` filter was removed entirely. Staff can now type a name, phone, address, or order # and see past delivered orders right in the orders list. Tab filters still work exactly as before — the change only affects active searches.

2. **Delivered tab widened from 24h to 7 days.** New constant `DELIVERED_TAB_WINDOW_DAYS = 7` replaces the two hardcoded `24 * 60 * 60 * 1000` expressions in `getFilteredOrders` and `updateOrderFilterCounts`. Past-week deliveries are now one click away on the Delivered pill. Raising the window further is a one-line change.

3. **"Recall to Route" button.** When the order panel is open on a delivered order, the primary footer button flips from "Advance Status" (hidden — doesn't apply) to "↩ Recall to Route" (amber/warning colored). Clicking it opens a modal with:
   - Order summary (#N — customer name)
   - An amber info banner reminding staff "No SMS is sent to the customer"
   - A dropdown of upcoming routes from the existing `_opRoutes` cache (reused from the reschedule flow — no extra query)
   - An optional free-text "reason" field (e.g. "Delivered by mistake")
   - Cancel + "Recall to Route" buttons

**The recall flow (`confirmRecallOrder`):**
1. Pulls the picked route's `window_start`/`window_end` from the DB so the order inherits a sensible new delivery window.
2. UPDATEs the orders row atomically: `status = 'out_for_delivery'` (if route runs today) or `'ready_for_delivery'` (if future), `actual_delivery_at = null`, `delivery_run_id = picked`, `routing_error = null`, plus the new window.
3. Finds the existing delivery stop for this order (any status) and UPDATEs it back to `pending` on the picked route with `driver_id = null`, `completed_at = null`, `proof_photo_url = null`. If the stop no longer exists (edge case for previously-deleted stops), INSERTs a fresh pending one with the next available `stop_number`.
4. Logs an `order_events` row with `event_type = 'recalled'`, description including the route name and optional reason, `actor_name = currentUserFirstName || 'Admin'`.
5. Calls `autoOptimizeRoute(routeId)` in the background to re-sequence the stops on the new route.
6. Closes the panel, refreshes the list, toasts success.
7. **No SMS.** Verified that `send-order-notification` is only invoked from explicit app code (admin-dashboard, driver-app, customer-app) and never from DB triggers — skipping the call on the recall path guarantees the customer won't be notified.

**Trigger safety audit:** Before shipping, every trigger on the `orders` table was reviewed for behavior when transitioning delivered → out_for_delivery / ready_for_delivery:
- `sync_stops_on_order_terminal` — only fires for terminal statuses; recall target isn't terminal → no-op.
- `trg_create_recurring_order_fn` — only fires for delivered/skipped/pickup_failed; recall target isn't → no-op.
- `sync_delivery_stop_on_window_change` — early-returns if `delivery_run_id` changed (which it does in recall) → no-op.
- `reconcile_stop_route_on_run_change` — only moves `pending` stops; the stop is still `complete` at the moment this trigger fires → no-op. Our JS then updates the stop manually.
- `sync_stops_on_order_status_advance` — marks pickup stop complete (already is) → no-op.
- `log_order_change` — writes benign audit entries for status_change + routed + rescheduled. Additive, harmless.

**Permissions:** David was explicit — "this rollback feature needs to be available to anyone with access to orders, not just ADMIN permissions. This includes users with MANAGER permission set as well." The recall button inherits page-level `canAccessPage('orders')` gating just like every other order action; no additional role check. Works for admin AND manager AND any custom role with orders access.

**Latent bug fixed as a side-effect:** The `#op-advance-btn` element had `style="flex:1;display:none"` in HEAD with no JS ever setting `display` back to visible, meaning the primary Advance button was invisible in production. The old `opRefreshAdvanceBtn` never touched `display`. The refactor for recall now explicitly toggles display per status, so the Advance button is also visible again for all non-delivered statuses. David's team had been using the status-badge dropdown instead and never noticed.

**New `'recalled'` event type:** `opRenderHistoryEvent` switch now has a case for `'recalled'` with a ↩️ icon so history entries render cleanly alongside `status_change`, `rescheduled`, etc.

**Known minor bookkeeping drift:** `routes.total_stops` may be off by 1 on the old/new route after a recall because `reconcile_stop_route_on_run_change` looks for pending stops and the recalled stop is still `complete` when the trigger fires. Impact is cosmetic — the RCC re-queries stop counts on refresh. Not blocking. Can be addressed in a follow-up if badge counts become an operational issue.

**Files touched:**
- `admin-dashboard/index.html` — added `recall-order-modal` HTML (above MODALS section), added `opRecallOrder` / `closeRecallModal` / `confirmRecallOrder` JS (after `opSkipOrder`), refactored `opRefreshAdvanceBtn` to toggle Advance vs Recall button, added `'recalled'` icon to history renderer, removed `INACTIVE_STATUSES` constant, introduced `DELIVERED_TAB_WINDOW_DAYS = 7`, updated filter badge, updated empty-state copy, updated `ORDER_FILTER_GROUPS` comment. Added `op-recall-btn` to order panel footer.

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
- `DELIVERED_TAB_WINDOW_DAYS` is the single place to tune how much delivered history the Delivered tab shows. Search is unbounded (bounded only by `allOrders` which is paginated-all).
- If you add another event type to `order_events`, remember to add a case to `opRenderHistoryEvent` so it renders with a matching icon.
- When adding new order-panel actions that should show only for a specific status, mirror the recall pattern: add an HTML button with `display:none`, toggle visibility in `opRefreshAdvanceBtn`, no role check needed (inherits page access).

### Apr 9, 2026 (session 98) — Hardened reschedule sync triggers (time-of-day hard filter + capacity advisory + window revert)

**Context:** Morning audit surfaced 3 wrong-date stops AND 1 wrong-template stop — the exact same bug class session 95 claimed to have "permanently fixed" via SECURITY DEFINER. David asked: "Explain how wrong date stops are still happening given the work we did yesterday to permanently resolve this."

**The answer:** Session 95's SECURITY DEFINER fix solved the RLS silent-failure problem (triggers can now successfully WRITE to `route_stops`). But it did NOT fix two other defects in the same trigger bodies that were independent of permissions:

1. **Template selection was sloppy.** The `FOR v_tmpl IN SELECT ... ORDER BY CASE WHEN v_new_pickup_time BETWEEN window_start AND window_end THEN 0 ELSE 1 END` loop used `ORDER BY` as a preference, not a filter. If the preferred template was full (capacity check `CONTINUE`d it), the loop would silently fall back to the next template — which could be an **AM template for a PM time**, producing a wrong-template stop. This is how Lisa Sturges' 8pm delivery landed on the Apr 11 Oakland AM route.

2. **Over-capacity meant silent stranding.** The capacity check inside the template loop was `IF v_stop_count >= v_tmpl.stop_limit THEN CONTINUE; END IF;`. If EVERY matching template was over capacity, the loop finished with `v_moved = FALSE`, the trigger set `NEW.routing_error := 'rescheduled_no_capacity'` — and then did nothing else. The window change went through, but the route_stop stayed on the OLD date. The downstream `reconcile_stop_route_on_run_change` safety-net trigger couldn't save it because `run_id` never changed on the stop. The order looked rescheduled in the admin UI, but the physical stop was still on yesterday's route.

**Why the audit caught 3 new cases overnight:** This bug fires any time an admin drags an order to a new date/time AND the target route is at capacity OR no matching template exists. It's been silently producing wrong-date stops since long before session 95 — SECURITY DEFINER just wasn't the whole story.

**The morning audit data fixes (4 stops moved):**
- **#2011 Lisa Sturges** — pickup moved to Oakland AM Apr 10 (`df790074...`), delivery moved to Oakland PM Apr 11 (`3484edfb...`), `routing_error` cleared. This order also had Bug #1 (wrong-template) on the delivery side — it was on Oakland AM Apr 11 at 8pm.
- **#2026 Kalen Gleeson** — delivery moved to Oakland AM Apr 10 (`df790074...`).
- **#2070 Ian Knox** — delivery moved to Oakland PM Apr 10 (`d793b126...`), `routing_error` cleared.

The moves were done via `UPDATE orders SET pickup_run_id/delivery_run_id = ...` and the `reconcile_stop_route_on_run_change` trigger handled the route_stop relocation automatically.

**The permanent fix (migration `harden_reschedule_sync_triggers_session98`):** Both `sync_pickup_stop_on_window_change()` and `sync_delivery_stop_on_window_change()` were replaced with hardened versions containing three structural changes:

1. **Time-of-day hard filter in `WHERE` clause** — The template `FOR` loop now has:
   ```sql
   AND v_new_pickup_time >= window_start
   AND v_new_pickup_time < window_end
   ```
   A wrong-time template literally cannot be considered. This eliminates Bug #1 (wrong-template fallback).

2. **Capacity is advisory, not gating** — The capacity check no longer does `CONTINUE`. The stop is ALWAYS moved to the correct date/route. If the target is over its `stop_limit`, the trigger sets `NEW.routing_error := 'over_capacity_after_reschedule'` so the order shows up in the morning audit for manual rebalancing. Eliminates Bug #2 when a matching template exists.

3. **Window revert when NO time-matching template exists** — If the loop finishes without finding ANY template that matches the new time-of-day, the trigger:
   - Reverts `NEW.pickup_window_start := OLD.pickup_window_start`, same for `pickup_window_end` (delivery equivalent on the delivery trigger).
   - Sets `NEW.routing_error := 'reschedule_no_matching_template'`.
   - `RAISE WARNING` so it shows up in Postgres logs.
   The reschedule fails cleanly — the order stays on its old window and the admin gets an obvious error state instead of a silently half-moved order.

Both functions remain `SECURITY DEFINER` (session 95 protection preserved).

**Migration review completed (washroute-migration-review skill):**
- No schema changes, no column adds/drops, no FK changes, no RLS changes, no new tables.
- Two function bodies replaced, trigger definitions untouched.
- Fully reversible — prior function source was captured in the session before the migration ran, and a rollback script can restore it verbatim if needed.
- Post-migration verification confirmed both functions have `security_definer = true`, `has_revert_fix = YES`, `has_capacity_advisory = YES`, `has_time_hard_filter = YES`. All three triggers (`trg_sync_pickup_stop_on_window_change`, `trg_sync_delivery_stop_on_window_change`, `trg_reconcile_stop_route`) are still enabled (`tgenabled = 'O'`).

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
1. **The daily audit must now include `routing_error` surveillance.** Add a check for `orders WHERE routing_error IN ('over_capacity_after_reschedule', 'reschedule_no_matching_template') AND pickup_window_start >= CURRENT_DATE`. These are orders that tried to reschedule and got flagged by the hardened trigger — they need manual admin attention.
2. **The capacity check is now advisory.** This means you can legitimately end up with routes over their `stop_limit` after a reschedule. The morning audit's over-capacity check remains essential — it's now the primary feedback loop for "this route is full" instead of the (now-removed) silent `CONTINUE`.
3. **Carry-forward from morning audit (not yet addressed this session):**
   - Over-capacity Oakland routes: Apr 10 AM 29/18, Apr 10 PM 22/18, Apr 11 PM 19/18 — need rebalancing.
   - Duplicate customer investigation: Homebase/Soul Sanctuary share a phone number; Reup/Re-Up share an email.
   - Nit Pixies duplicate orders #1934/#1935.
   - ~15 `billing_status='failed'` orders worth a batch retry.
   - 19 SMS opt-out sync issues between `customers` and Twilio.
   - 8 driverless routes across the next 7 days.

**Files touched:**
- DB migration: `harden_reschedule_sync_triggers_session98` (replaces both sync functions).
- Data: 3 order rows updated (pickup_run_id / delivery_run_id / routing_error).
- No app code changes (admin/driver/customer unchanged).

### Apr 8, 2026 (session 97 part 3) — customer_type → pricelist rename (migration 1 of 2, zero-downtime)

**Why this was needed:** The `customers.customer_type` column had become a tangled mess. Its original purpose ("is this a residential or commercial customer?") had drifted over time and was being (mis)read in several places — sometimes as a price list selector, sometimes as a service category proxy. The admin dashboard's "Price List" dropdown was even populating from `service_categories` (which had a stray "Retail" entry), so admins could accidentally assign a non-existent price list. The whole concept needed a clean rename + a hardened, opinionated meaning.

**The new definition (David's policy):**
- Every customer belongs to exactly ONE price list — `'Delivery'` or `'Commercial'`.
- Admin assigns the price list manually. It is NEVER auto-derived and NEVER driven by customer self-selection.
- A customer on the Commercial price list gets Commercial pricing EVERYWHERE: admin intake panel, customer-app self-serve, recurring orders, new orders.

**Zero-downtime strategy — bidirectional sync trigger (migration 1 of 2):**
The classic risk with a rename is the ~60s Vercel deploy window where old cached clients still write `customer_type` while new code reads `pricelist`. Instead of a high-risk big-bang rename, this session introduced a transition window:

1. **Added `pricelist` column** (NOT NULL, default `'Delivery'`, CHECK `IN ('Delivery', 'Commercial')`). Backfilled all 5,399 rows from normalized `customer_type` values → 5,371 Delivery / 28 Commercial.
2. **Installed `trg_sync_customer_type_pricelist`** — a BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE trigger that keeps both columns in perfect agreement. Old code writing to `customer_type` gets normalized into `pricelist`; new code writing to `pricelist` mirrors back to `customer_type`. Both directions handled.
3. **Updated `trg_create_recurring_order_fn`** to read `pricelist` instead of `customer_type`.
4. **Shipped all app code on `pricelist`** in a single atomic commit (`d9e1f4f`).
5. **Migration 2 (next session or tomorrow):** drop `customer_type` + drop the sync trigger.

**App code changes (commit `d9e1f4f`, 5 files):**
- **admin-dashboard/index.html:** Every customer SELECT/UPDATE now uses `pricelist`. Customer panel price list dropdown is now hardcoded to the two valid price lists (previously it was being populated from `service_categories`, which included a stray "Retail" option — a latent bug where admins could accidentally assign a price list that didn't exist in `services.pricelist`). The `customerType` variable in `openIntakePanel` was renamed to `customerPricelist` throughout.
- **customer-app/index.html:** `getCustomerService()` reads `currentCustomer.pricelist` instead of `customer_type`. Added explicit comments clarifying that price list is admin-assigned and NOT derived from customer self-selection — this was the root of earlier confusion about whether the customer app should "offer" residential vs commercial.
- **pos/index.html:** Walk-in customer creation writes `pricelist: 'Delivery'` (was `customer_type: 'retail'` — another stale value that didn't match the CHECK constraint anyway). Admin can promote walk-ins to Commercial later via the customer panel.
- **outreach-sms.js / outreach-email.js:** Group B queries now filter Commercial price list customers (`pricelist !== 'Commercial'`) instead of a toLowerCase match on the old field.

**Drive-by fixes caught while touching these files:**
- `loadFolding` and `loadCleaning` were only pulling `services(name)` — a latent display/billing gap where the folding and cleaning queues couldn't correctly render per-lb vs per-bag pricing for Commercial orders. Both now join the full services shape (`id, name, base_price, pricing_type, lbs_per_bag, overage_rate_per_lb, pricelist`) and pull `line_items`, matching the Intake query pattern.

**Pre-commit QA (washroute-qa with blast radius check):**
- Zero remaining `customer_type` references anywhere in `.html` or `.js` files across all three apps + POS + outreach scripts.
- Only the sync trigger function itself references `customer_type` in the DB (intentional — it's the bridge).
- Spot-checked 6 critical edge functions (charge-order, stripe-webhook, on-customer-created, send-order-notification, send-scheduled-reminders, backfill-stripe-ids) — none reference `customer_type`. No edge function changes required.
- No customer pricelist assignments changed as a side effect of this work (David explicitly confirmed: "leave as is" — no retroactive credits for the two earlier over-charged Level Up Wellness orders).

**⚠️ For future sessions:**
1. **Migration 2 is still pending.** Before dropping `customer_type`, run this across the codebase one last time: `grep -rn "customer_type" customer-app/ admin-dashboard/ driver-app/ pos/ outreach-*.js supabase/functions/` — expect zero hits. Also check `pg_proc` for any DB functions that still reference it. If clean, drop the sync trigger first, then drop the column.
2. **The "Price List" dropdown is now hardcoded** to Delivery/Commercial. If a future requirement adds a third price list (e.g. a new "Wholesale" tier), remember you need to: (a) add it to the `pricelist` CHECK constraint, (b) add the `<option>` to the admin dashboard dropdown, (c) update `getCustomerService()` in customer-app, (d) update the `services.pricelist` CHECK constraint if services also need it, and (e) ensure outreach scripts don't exclude the new tier accidentally.
3. **Never drive price list from customer self-selection in the app.** The customer app reads `currentCustomer.pricelist` as ground truth. If a product decision later allows customers to choose their own tier, the assignment still needs to flow through an admin-approved path — not a direct write from the customer session.

**Files touched:**
- DB: `customers` table (+ `pricelist` column, CHECK constraint, sync trigger, `trg_create_recurring_order_fn` updated). Migration names: `add_pricelist_column_alongside_customer_type`.
- `admin-dashboard/index.html` (12 targeted edits)
- `customer-app/index.html` (1 edit + clarifying comments)
- `pos/index.html` (1 edit)
- `outreach-sms.js`, `outreach-email.js` (query + filter updates)
- Commit: `d9e1f4f` refactor: rename customers.customer_type → pricelist (migration 1 of 2)

### Apr 8, 2026 (session 97 part 2) — Elvis Kahoro status desync (delivery_failed cascade missing + en_route stop filter)

**Symptom:** Order #1459 (Elvis Kahoro) showed `delivery_failed` on the order but its delivery route_stop was stuck in `en_route`. This was the morning audit's issue #2.

**Root cause — TWO bugs both contributed:**

1. **`auto_fail_expired_orders` only updated `pending` stops, not `en_route`.** The driver hit "On My Way" at 5:20pm Apr 7 (stop → `en_route`) but never confirmed delivery. The cron `auto-fail-expired-orders` (runs every 30 min) caught the order at midnight Pacific, set `order.status = 'delivery_failed'`, and tried to mark the stop failed — but its WHERE clause was `status = 'pending'`. The `en_route` stop didn't match → orphaned. The pickup branch had the same bug (latent — would only manifest if a driver hit "On My Way" on a pickup stop and then never returned to confirm).

2. **`sync_stops_on_order_terminal` had no `delivery_failed` branch at all.** The cascade trigger (which is supposed to be a safety net regardless of which code path sets the order status) handles `delivered`, `cancelled`, `pickup_failed`, `skipped` — but not `delivery_failed`. So even if `auto_fail_expired_orders` were fixed, ANY other caller setting `delivery_failed` (admin manual, future automation, edge function) would still leave delivery stops orphaned. The trigger's WHEN clause also missed `delivery_failed`, so even adding a body branch wouldn't have fired.

**Fix (migration `fix_delivery_failed_cascade_and_en_route_filter`):**
- `sync_stops_on_order_terminal`: added a `delivery_failed` branch that marks the delivery stop as `failed` (pickup is left alone — bags are already with us, so pickup must be `complete` already by the time delivery fails).
- Recreated `trg_sync_stops_on_order_terminal` with `delivery_failed` added to the WHEN clause so the trigger actually fires for that status.
- `auto_fail_expired_orders`: both pickup and delivery stop UPDATEs now match `status IN ('pending', 'en_route')` instead of just `pending`. Also added `updated_at = NOW()` so the audit dashboard can sort by recency.
- All 3 functions remain SECURITY DEFINER.

**Why this is belt-and-suspenders, not redundant:** The cron's stop-update is the primary path during automatic expiration. The cascade trigger is the safety net for any OTHER code path (admin, edge function, manual SQL) that sets `delivery_failed`. Both should leave the same final state, and the trigger's UPDATE is a no-op on rows already in `failed`/`skipped`/`complete`.

**Data fix:** Manually updated Elvis #1459's stuck stop (`8cda6e8b...`) from `en_route` → `failed`. Re-ran the desync check across all `delivery_failed`, `pickup_failed`, `delivered`, and `cancelled` orders → zero rows.

**SMS fan-out check:** No change to the cron's SMS behavior. Same orders get caught, same `pickup_failed` template body gets sent, same recipients. The fix is strictly about route_stops state.

**⚠️ For future sessions:** When checking the cascade trigger's coverage, the rule is: every value in the order status enum that should propagate to route_stops must appear in BOTH the function body AND the trigger WHEN clause. The current covered set is: `delivered`, `cancelled`, `pickup_failed`, `delivery_failed`, `skipped`. If a new order status is added (e.g., `partial_delivery`, `lost_in_processing`), update both places.

### Apr 8, 2026 (session 97 part 1) — Route template override respected by all 4 routing functions

**Symptom:** Morning audit flagged a wrong-date stop on Meg Lamberton order #1937. Recurring weekly: pickup Mon Apr 13 12:00 PT, delivery Tue Apr 14 09:00 PT, but the delivery stop landed on the **Apr 15** COMMERCIAL route instead of Apr 14.

**Root cause (latent since session 94):** When `route_template_override_id` was added to customers (session 94 — needed for non-zone-based commercial accounts like Meg Lamberton and Always Fishing), only the **template-lookup loops** in `auto_route_order` were updated. Three other code paths still assumed zone-based residential routing:

1. **`auto_route_order` PM-bridging block** — A residential-AM/PM heuristic: when `pickup_time >= 12:00` AND `delivery_time < 12:00` AND `delivery_date <= pickup+1`, it searches for "any template in this zone with `window_start >= 12:00`". For an override customer, `zone_id` doesn't match COMMERCIAL (zone_id is NULL on the template), so no PM template is found, and the fallback path bumps `delivery_date += 1`. Meg's Apr 14 delivery slid to Apr 15.

2. **`sync_pickup_stop_on_window_change`** — Trigger that moves a pickup stop when the order's pickup window date changes. Its template lookup hardcoded `WHERE zone_id = NEW.zone_id`, so any pickup edit on an override customer would fail to find a template (latent bug — would have surfaced the next time anyone edited Meg's pickup window).

3. **`sync_delivery_stop_on_window_change`** — Same pattern, same latent bug for delivery edits.

4. **`trg_auto_route_new_order`** — Pre-flight check refused to call `auto_route_order` for orders with `zone_id IS NULL`, even if the customer had an override. This meant new override orders silently got `routing_error = 'No zone assigned to this order'` and never routed.

**Why Always Fishing (the other override customer) wasn't affected by symptom 1:** Always Fishing #1940 was admin-created via the new-order modal, which pre-sets `pickup_run_id` and `delivery_run_id` directly — bypassing `trg_auto_route_new_order` entirely. The PM-bridging bug only fires when `auto_route_order` is invoked from the recurring-order trigger (which doesn't pre-set run_ids).

**Fix (migration `fix_route_template_override_in_routing_functions`):**
- All 4 functions now check `customers.route_template_override_id` first.
- `auto_route_order`: PM-bridging block now skipped entirely when override is set (the override IS the customer's template choice — bridging is residential AM/PM logic that doesn't apply to single-window override templates like COMMERCIAL 09–15).
- The two `sync_*_window_change` triggers: template lookup now matches `(override_id IS NOT NULL AND id = override_id) OR (override_id IS NULL AND zone_id = NEW.zone_id)`.
- `trg_auto_route_new_order`: now allows override customers to route even without `zone_id`.
- All 4 remain SECURITY DEFINER (required because they write to `route_stops`).

**Data fix:** Moved Meg #1937's delivery stop (id `6a18fde6...`) from the Apr 15 COMMERCIAL route to the Apr 14 COMMERCIAL route. `moved_from_route_id` set so it shows up in the audit dashboard. `delivery_run_id` on the order updated to match. Verified with the wrong-date stop check: zero rows.

**⚠️ For future sessions:** When adding a new code path that uses zone-based routing, always check if `route_template_override_id` should also be respected. The 2 customers currently using overrides (Meg Lamberton, Always Fishing) both have a NULL `zone_id` because COMMERCIAL is a non-zone template — any code that requires `zone_id` will silently break for them. The pattern is: `IF override IS NOT NULL THEN match by template id, ELSE match by zone_id`.

**Files touched:**
- DB: 4 functions replaced via migration
- Rollback SQL saved at `migration-route-override-fix.sql` + `rollback-route-override-fix.sql`
- No app code changes (admin/driver/customer apps are unaffected)

### Apr 7, 2026 (session 96) — Code audit: batched queries, SECURITY DEFINER sweep, ghost stops, pricelist race

**Critical fix — "No card on file" on all orders (commit `43a4c97`):**
- David woke up to every order showing ⚠️ "Request card" / "No card on file" warnings. Cards were fine in the DB (659 cards).
- Root cause: The `.in('customer_id', custIds)` query in `loadOrders` passed 632 UUIDs in a single GET request URL, generating a ~23KB query string that exceeded the Supabase API gateway limit (~16KB). The query silently failed, `_custWithCard` became an empty Set, and every order showed no card.
- Fix: Added `batchedIn()` helper that chunks large ID arrays into groups of 200 (well under URL limit). Applied to all 5 `.in()` calls in loadOrders (payment methods, SMS requests, email requests) and the billing/customer list views.
- **⚠️ For future sessions:** Never pass more than ~200 UUIDs to a single Supabase `.in()` filter. Use the `batchedIn()` helper for any large ID array query.

**Migration `promote_remaining_route_stop_triggers_to_security_definer`:**
- Discovered 4 more trigger functions writing to route_stops as SECURITY INVOKER: `sync_stops_on_order_terminal`, `sync_stops_on_order_status_advance`, `reset_failed_delivery_stop`, `sync_stop_address_on_order_address_change`. All promoted to SECURITY DEFINER.
- This was the root cause of ghost stops — when orders were cancelled/skipped, the cascade trigger couldn't update route_stops due to RLS, leaving orphaned "pending" stops.

**Data fixes:**
- Cleaned 9 ghost stops (orders #1278, #1283, #1771, #1830, #1838) — marked as skipped.
- Recalculated `total_stops` on 44 routes that had drifted from actual pending stop counts.

**Code fixes:**
- `confirmMoveStop()` (admin dashboard) now syncs the order's `pickup_run_id`/`delivery_run_id` when a stop is moved between routes in the RCC map view. Previously the stop moved but the order record still pointed to the old route.
- Customer app: Commercial pricelist fetch changed from fire-and-forget to `await`. Previously, if a Commercial customer started an order before the async fetch completed, they got residential (per-bag) pricing instead of commercial (per-lb).

### Apr 7, 2026 (session 95) — Wrong-date stops root cause fix (SECURITY DEFINER + reconcile trigger)

- **Root cause identified and fixed (migration `fix_stop_sync_security_definer_and_reconcile_trigger`):** The #1 recurring bug across sessions 62-94 — stops landing on wrong-date routes — was caused by `sync_pickup_stop_on_window_change()` and `sync_delivery_stop_on_window_change()` being SECURITY INVOKER. When a non-admin user (customer app edit, recurring order trigger, system process) changed order windows, the trigger tried to UPDATE route_stops but was silently blocked by RLS (only `is_admin()` can write to route_stops). The order's `pickup_run_id`/`delivery_run_id` got updated to the correct new route, but the actual route_stop record stayed stranded on the old route. Fixed by promoting both functions to SECURITY DEFINER — same pattern as `auto_route_order` and `trg_auto_route_new_order`.

- **Safety-net reconcile trigger added (`trg_reconcile_stop_route`):** AFTER UPDATE trigger on orders that fires whenever `pickup_run_id` or `delivery_run_id` changes. Verifies the corresponding route_stop is on the correct route; moves it if not. Catches the edge case where the BEFORE trigger skips (when both window and run_id change in the same UPDATE, the trigger exits early) but the admin JS stop-move doesn't execute. SECURITY DEFINER, idempotent — if the stop is already on the right route, no-op.

- **8 existing mismatched stops fixed:** Orders #1242 (Briana Berger), #1603 (Cosmin Radoi), #1605 (Sahlee Tongson), #1830 (Jennifer Stahl), #1904 (Elizabeth Clements) all had pending stops stranded on old routes. Moved to correct routes in a single reconciliation query.

- **⚠️ IMPORTANT for future sessions:** All trigger functions that write to `route_stops` MUST be SECURITY DEFINER. Route_stops has RLS that restricts writes to `is_admin()`. If a new trigger is added that needs to move/create/update route_stops, make it SECURITY DEFINER or the writes will silently fail for non-admin callers.

### Apr 1, 2026 (session 88) — Card request fix, duplicate credit cleanup, skip/fail consolidation

**Bug fix — "Request card" button stuck (commit `189c834`):**
- David reported Dagny Brown's button stuck at "Request card" despite pressing it multiple times over 2 days.
- Root cause: SMS lookup used `'%card on file%'` but actual SMS body says `"payment method on file"`. Email lookup matched `eq('subject', 'Add your card to Family Laundry')` but actual subject is `"Action needed: payment for order #..."`. Neither pattern matched → `_cardRequestSent` map was always empty.
- Fix: SMS lookup now matches `'%app.familylaundry.com%'` (universal marker in all outbound SMS). Email lookup now uses `.or()` filter matching all 3 known subject variants: "Action needed: payment...", "Add your card to Family Laundry", "Your Family Laundry balance".
- Fixed in both `issueActionBtn` and `_deliveredActionBtn` functions (two parallel lookup locations).

**Duplicate $20 launch promo credits cleaned up:**
- Audited all customers — found several with duplicate $20 credits from `trg_signup_promo_credit` firing multiple times.
- Deleted erroneous duplicate `credit_add` entries from `customer_transactions`.
- Accounted for credits already applied to orders (via `line_items` JSON) to avoid over-correcting balances.

**$20 promo trigger disabled:**
- `trg_signup_promo_credit` on `customer_payment_methods` — now DISABLED. Promo deadline (March 31) had already passed, but trigger was still enabled. Disabled cleanly.

**Skip/fail consolidation — "Can't Complete" button (commit `7decbd3`):**
- Drivers confused by two buttons ("Skip This Stop" and "Failed Pickup") doing essentially the same thing.
- Replaced with single "Can't Complete" button that shows a reason picker bottom sheet: Bags not out, Can't access, Customer not home, Customer requested skip, Other.
- All driver-initiated incompletes now set `orders.status = 'pickup_failed'`, `cancelled_by = 'driver'`, `driver_skip_reason = [reason]`. Route stop uses `skipped` status (per DB constraint).
- Customer gets `pickup_failed` SMS notification on all "Can't Complete" actions.
- Undo (12s window) fully restores: order status, cancelled_by, driver_skip_reason, route_stop status, and driver_notes.
- Admin Issues tab badge now shows reason: e.g. "Can't Complete (Bags not out)" instead of generic "Pickup Failed".
- DB migration: added `driver_skip_reason` (text, nullable) to orders table.
- Customer/admin-initiated skips unchanged — still use `skipped` status.
- All DB triggers verified compatible: `trg_create_recurring_order_fn` fires on both `skipped` and `pickup_failed`, `sync_stops_on_order_terminal` handles `pickup_failed` correctly.

**Still pending:**
- Annie Reid order #1021 ($187.95) — delivered, has Visa 4686, never charged. Flagged as chargeable, awaiting go-ahead.
- Git: David pushed card request fix + consolidation commit from terminal.

### Apr 2, 2026 (session 90) — RCC chip strip redesign, discount intake wiring, Kidango billing fix

**RCC chip strip — stacked AM/PM rows (commits `97ca001`, `53c29a1`):**
- Luis (colleague) couldn't see all routes on the Order Schedule map — AM/PM toggle was functioning as a hard filter, hiding any route not matching the active slot, and closing columns when the slot switched.
- Fix 1: `rccSetSlot()` neutered to no-op; `rccAutoOpenSlotRoutes()` now opens ALL routes with ≥1 pending stop regardless of slot.
- Fix 2: Chip strip redesigned from a single scrolling row with AM/PM toggle to two stacked rows with static "AM" / "PM" labels. `rccRenderChips()` splits templates into `amTemplates` (window_start < 12) and `pmTemplates` (window_start ≥ 12) and renders each as a `.rcc-chip-row`. Scroll arrows and arrow nav functions removed.
- Routes are now always visible — no filter, no toggle, no hiding.

**Overview "Requires Rescheduling" — recurring icon added:**
- Orders with a `recurring_interval` now show the green ↺ recurring icon next to the customer name in the Requires Rescheduling table, matching the styling on the Orders list page.
- Uses existing `_recurSvg(interval)` helper.

**Rae Kaplan card investigation (root cause found, not auto-fixed):**
- Stripe auto-detaches a payment method after a failed off-session charge attempt. Our `stripe-webhook` has no `payment_method.detached` handler, so `customer_payment_methods` in the DB still shows the card as active even after Stripe has removed it.
- This is the same drift bug that caused Rae's "Update card" error loop.
- Short-term: David will send Rae a new checkout link to re-add her card.
- **⚠️ Tech debt:** `stripe-webhook` needs a `payment_method.detached` handler that sets `customer_payment_methods.is_active = false` (or deletes the row) when Stripe fires this event. Without it, charge-order will keep trying detached cards and failing.

**Commercial billing root-cause fix — `saveIntake()` never wrote `service_id` (commit `5f683b8`):**
- All 110 Kidango orders created March 31 had `service_id = NULL` from a bulk migration that didn't set it.
- Additionally, `saveIntake()` never included `service_id` in its DB update object, so the service linkage was permanently lost at intake even when `procSvc` was correctly set in memory.
- Fix: `saveIntake()` now writes `service_id: procSvc?.id || null` on every intake save.
- Backfill: All 110 Kidango orders updated to correct service_id.

**Kidango billing corrected — Delivery pricelist + NON PROFIT discount (commit `5f683b8`):**
- David clarified: Kidango (non-profit) should be on the **Delivery pricelist** ($59/bag), not Commercial ($1.75/lb).
- Discount: NON PROFIT (5% off) applies to the base service charge only (not delivery fee), shown as a separate line item at the bottom of the itemization.
- DB changes:
  - 16 Kidango customer profiles: `discount_id` set to NON PROFIT discount UUID.
  - 110 Kidango orders: `service_id` switched from Commercial W&F → Delivery W&F (`d97ba33a`).
  - 16 processing orders: `total_amount` and `line_items` recalculated at bags × $59 − 5% + $9.95 delivery. Range: $66.00 (1 bag) to $458.35 (8 bags).

**Discount system wired to intake flow (commit `5f683b8`):**
- Discounts were stored on customer profiles (`discount_id`) but never applied during intake — the `calcProcTotal()` / `_buildIntakeLineItems()` pipeline ignored them entirely.
- Added `procCustomerDiscount` variable (alongside `procCustomerCredits`).
- `openIntakePanel()` fresh customer fetch now includes `discount_id` and resolves it against `allDiscounts` cache.
- `calcProcTotal()`: computes `discountAmt = base × pct / 100`; subtracts from subtotal before credit application.
- `_buildIntakeLineItems()`: appends a `discount` line item (negative amount, label shows name + %) after delivery fee, before credits.
- `saveIntake()`: now writes both `service_id` and `discount_id` to the order record.
- Works for any discount in the system (percent or fixed), not just NON PROFIT.

**Completed in session 91 continuation (same day):**
- ✅ Backfilled 3 commercial orders in Cleaning with NULL service_id: Kasa Hotel Addison ($9.95 → $44.95), Kasa Hotels La Monarca (label fixed, amount already correct at $400.20), Homebase Shelter Program ($9.95 → $270.70). All set to Commercial W&F (per_lb, $1.75/lb).
- ✅ Ghost stops cleared: 12 pending route_stops on cancelled/skipped orders → all set to `skipped`.
- ✅ Wrong-date stops fixed: Katie Guadagno #1569 delivery moved from Apr 2 → Apr 3 route; Suzanne Stroebe #949 delivery moved from Apr 8 → Apr 4 Oakland route (94609, route `ce177574`).
- ✅ Customer profile Orders tabs consolidated: removed Cancelled + Billing tabs, merged into single Completed tab (billing UI).
- AlbertH HartIII duplicate orders #1545/#1584 — deferred to customer service. #1584 pickup is complete/ready_for_delivery, #1545 is still scheduled with pickup en_route. Keep #1584, cancel #1545 if confirmed duplicate.

**Still pending:**
- Rae Kaplan: resolved per David.
- `stripe-webhook` `payment_method.detached` handler — tech debt, not yet built.
- Annie Reid order #1021 ($187.95) — charged successfully by David.
- David Glasebrook order #774 — insufficient funds, needs card request outreach.
- 13 no-card customers need card request outreach.
- 6 on-account customers need invoicing.

### Apr 4, 2026 (session 94) — Route template override, rack flow race condition fix, native app scaffold

**Route template override — assign customers to non-zone routes (commits `2500653` + DB migration):**
- David needed Mama Meg Massage (Meg Lamberton) on the COMMERCIAL route instead of her zone-based route.
- Added `route_template_override_id` column to `customers` table (FK → `route_templates`, ON DELETE SET NULL).
- Updated `auto_route_order()` DB function: when a customer has an override set, both pickup and delivery template matching use the override template ID instead of zone-based matching. Falls back to zone logic when override is NULL.
- Added "Route Override" dropdown to customer profile Contact tab in admin dashboard. Loads all active route templates, defaults to "— Default (zone-based) —". Saves on contact tab save.
- Meg Lamberton set to COMMERCIAL route (`94d436c4`). Her future orders will auto-route to COMMERCIAL regardless of her address zone.

**Rack flow race condition fix (commit `709db6a`):**
- Lauren Ripley order #1110: card charged successfully by Stripe but `billing_status` showed 'failed' in admin.
- Root cause: when an order is racked twice in quick succession, the second rack attempt uses stale in-memory data (no `stripe_payment_intent_id`). The `charge-order` edge function correctly rejects with "already been charged", but the dashboard error handler blindly wrote `billing_status = 'failed'`, overwriting the 'paid' status from the first successful charge.
- Two-layer fix in `admin-dashboard/index.html`:
  1. **Re-fetch before charge**: Before calling `charge-order`, re-fetch `stripe_payment_intent_id`, `billing_status`, and `rack_id` from DB. Skip charge if already paid.
  2. **Smart error handler**: "already been charged" errors now show an info toast and set `billing_status = 'paid'` (not 'failed'). Only genuine failures write 'failed'.
- Audit confirmed Lauren Ripley was the only affected order — all other 12 'failed' orders genuinely have no card on file.
- Lauren's `billing_status` corrected to 'paid' in DB.

**Capacitor native app scaffold (commit `709db6a`):**
- Created `customer-app-native/` project to wrap the customer web app as a downloadable iOS/Android app using Capacitor 7.
- Files: `capacitor.config.json`, `package.json`, `scripts/copy-web-assets.js` (build script), `scripts/native-bridge.js` (StatusBar, Keyboard, PushNotifications, App lifecycle), `scripts/generate-icons.js` (sharp-based icon/splash generation), `BUILD-GUIDE.md`, `.gitignore`.
- David installed Homebrew + Node.js on his Mac, ran `npm install`, `npx cap add ios`.
- **⚠️ Xcode build issue**: `LaunchScreen.storyboard` and `Main.storyboard` not found errors. Likely caused by corrupted initial `cap add ios`. Fix: `rm -rf ios && npx cap add ios && cp -R www/* ios/App/App/public/ && cd ios/App && pod install`. **David hasn't confirmed this fix yet — switched to route override feature.**

**Still pending:**
- Xcode storyboard fix — David needs to retry the `rm -rf ios && npx cap add ios` sequence.
- Firebase setup for push notifications in native app.
- `customer_push_tokens` table creation in Supabase.
- Privacy policy URL for App Store / Google Play submissions.
- `stripe-webhook` `payment_method.detached` handler — tech debt.
- David Glasebrook #774 — insufficient funds, needs card request outreach.
- 13 no-card customers need card request outreach.
- 6 on-account customers need invoicing.
- Duplicate orders: Madeleine Stephens, Bronwyn Ayla — deferred.

---

### Apr 3, 2026 (session 93) — Commercial pricelist fix, Reports overhaul, order deletion + panel fixes

**Order deletion on active routes (commit `dba54c6`):**
- David reported inability to delete orders on an active route (customer Golden State).
- Root cause: `route_stops.order_id` FK has NO `ON DELETE CASCADE`. Raw `orders.delete()` fails with FK violation.
- Fix: Switched `deleteOrder()` from raw delete to existing `delete_orders` RPC (SECURITY DEFINER function that cascades deletes on route_stops + notifications).

**Order panel cache miss (commit `dba54c6`):**
- David reported order panel not opening from customer profile.
- Root cause: `openOrderPanel()` searched global `allOrders` cache — customer profile orders not in cache = silent failure.
- Fix: Made `openOrderPanel()` async with DB fallback. If order not in cache, fetches from DB with full select (including joins), pushes to cache, then opens panel.

**Reports trailing-day periods (commit `cfc0500`):**
- Replaced calendar-based period tabs (This Week/Month/Quarter) with trailing-day tabs: Today, Yesterday, 7 Days, 30 Days, 90 Days.
- `rptDateRange()` rewritten to support trailing days with proper comparison periods.

**Revenue/LB calculation fix (commit `cfc0500`):**
- Was dividing ALL orders' revenue by ALL orders' weight — included scheduled/unprocessed orders inflating the number ($11.64/lb was wrong).
- Fixed to only include charged orders: Stripe-charged + billing_status='paid' + on_account customers.

**Revenue/bag stat card added:**
- New stat card on Reports page: Revenue/bag = chargedRevenue / chargedBags.
- Same filtering logic as Revenue/LB.

**⚠️ Commercial pricelist assignment — root cause + 3-layer fix:**
- **Problem discovered via Anita Hodzic order #1072**: Commercial customer showing Delivery pricelist ($59/bag) instead of Commercial ($1.75/lb).
- **Root cause**: Three broken pathways were assigning the wrong service to commercial customers:
  1. **Customer app**: `loadServices()` filters `.eq('show_in_app', true)`, but the Commercial W&F service has `show_in_app: false`. So `defaultService` was always the Delivery service, even for commercial customers.
  2. **Recurring trigger**: `trg_create_recurring_order_fn()` copied `service_id` from the previous order — if that order had the wrong service, all future recurring orders inherited it.
  3. **NULL service_id orders**: 30+ Kasa Hotel / Homebase orders created with NULL service_id from bulk migrations.
- **Fix 1 — Customer app** (`customer-app/index.html`): Added `getCustomerService()` helper. Pre-fetches the Commercial W&F service separately (bypassing `show_in_app` filter). When `currentCustomer.customer_type === 'Commercial'`, returns Commercial service instead of `defaultService`. All 4 call sites updated.
- **Fix 2 — Recurring trigger** (DB function `trg_create_recurring_order_fn`): Added service override block — looks up `customer_type`, and if Commercial, resolves the correct Commercial service_id regardless of what the previous order had.
- **Fix 3 — Bulk backfill**: 41 active commercial orders with wrong or NULL service_id updated to Commercial W&F (`14f01afc`). Affected customers: Ruth Pardue (1), Kasa Hotel Addison (12), Kasa Hotels La Monarca (16), Homebase Shelter Program (12), Anita Hodzic (1).
- **⚠️ CRITICAL: `customer_type = 'Commercial'` determines pricelist, not `billing_type`.** Not all commercial customers are on_account — some pay by card. The service selection logic must check `customer_type`, never `billing_type`.

**Still pending:**
- `stripe-webhook` `payment_method.detached` handler — tech debt.
- David Glasebrook #774 — insufficient funds, needs card request outreach.
- 13 no-card customers need card request outreach.
- 6 on-account customers need invoicing.
- Ghost stops: 4 stops need skipping (Amanda Fales, Monica Alarcon, Bessie Weiss).
- Duplicate orders: Madeleine Stephens, Bronwyn Ayla — deferred.
- Over-capacity routes: Oakland AM Apr 6 (21/18), Oakland PM Apr 8 (20/18), Oakland PM Apr 9 (19/18).

### Apr 2, 2026 (session 92) — Account Credit billing, isPaid fix, paid-order invoice export

**Account Credit billing (commit `01000bc`):**
- Added "Account Credit" as a payment method in the Bill Orders modal.
- When selected, deducts from customer's `credits` balance, marks orders as `billing_status='paid'` + `billing_payment_method='credit'`, logs a `credit_use` transaction in `customer_transactions`, and logs billing events per order.
- Shows real-time credit balance in the modal; warns if balance is insufficient.
- Applied successfully to Oakland Roots & Soul — $727.90 in credits applied to 2 outstanding orders.

**Credit billing freeze fix (commits `9f96fb1`, `b962083`):**
- First attempt froze because `created_by` column doesn't exist on `customer_transactions` and `currentAdmin` variable doesn't exist. Fixed to use `payment_method: 'credit'`.
- Second attempt: orders were marked paid in DB but UI still showed "Outstanding". Root cause: reordered operations — mark orders paid FIRST, deduct credits SECOND. Wrapped in try/catch with error toasts.

**isPaid check fix (commit `69fb4ff`):**
- `isPaid` in `renderCpOrders()` only checked `stripe_payment_intent_id`, missing credit/check/cash payments.
- Fixed to: `const isPaid = !!o.stripe_payment_intent_id || o.billing_status === 'paid'`
- Added payment method labels: "Paid (credit)", "Paid (check)", "Paid (cash)" badges.

**Paid-order invoice export (commit `5d3e041`):**
- Paid orders in the Completed tab were grayed out with disabled checkboxes — couldn't select them.
- Removed isPaid guards on checkbox disabled state and onclick handlers. Paid orders now selectable (slightly dimmed at 0.7 opacity, green Paid badge stays).
- `updateBillingBar()` now counts all selected orders (not just unpaid). When only paid orders are selected, "Bill Orders" button hides (nothing to bill) but "Print Invoice" stays visible.
- `printInvoice()` isPaid check also fixed to include `billing_status === 'paid'` (was only checking `stripe_payment_intent_id`). Receipts now show payment method: "✓ PAID (Account Credit)", "✓ PAID (Card)", etc.

**Unpaid orders audit:**
- 16 unpaid delivered orders audited for cards on file.
- David Glasebrook #774: attempted charge, insufficient funds.
- Annie Reid #1021: charged successfully by David.
- Rae Kaplan: resolved.
- 13 remaining customers have no card on file — need outreach.
- 6 on-account customers need invoicing separately.

### Apr 2, 2026 (session 91) — Commercial Cleaning backfill, ghost stops, Orders tab consolidation

**Commercial Cleaning backfill (3 orders with NULL service_id):**
- `pricing_type` was missing from the services join in all three kanban column queries (`loadProcessing`, `loadCleaning`, `loadFolding`) — `commit 3152204`. Without it, `isPerLb` was always false, causing commercial per-lb orders to show "X bags × $1.75" instead of "X lbs × $1.75/lb".
- 3 orders in Cleaning (status=processing) had NULL service_id and wrong amounts:
  - Kasa Hotel Addison: 20 lbs → $9.95 (was) → $44.95 (fixed). Service set to Commercial W&F.
  - Kasa Hotels La Monarca: 223 lbs → label "8 bags × $1.75" corrected to "223 lbs × $1.75/lb". Amount was already $400.20. Service_id set.
  - Homebase Shelter Program: 149 lbs → $9.95 (was) → $270.70 (fixed). Service set to Commercial W&F. No discount (confirmed by David).

**Ghost stops cleared:**
- Found 12 route_stops still in `pending` status on cancelled or skipped orders.
- Bulk-updated all to `skipped` (only valid terminal for route_stops per check constraint).
- Zero ghost stops remaining.

**Wrong-date stops fixed:**
- Katie Guadagno #1569 delivery: moved from Apr 2 route → Apr 3 route (`5a71a9f0`, same driver, stop #13).
- Suzanne Stroebe #949 delivery: moved from Apr 8 route → Apr 4 Oakland route (`ce177574`, 94609 zip coverage, stop #28).

**AlbertH HartIII duplicate orders #1545/#1584:**
- #1584 (Apr 2 morning): pickup complete, ready_for_delivery. #1545 (Apr 1 night): pickup en_route, still scheduled. Both delivery Apr 3.
- Deferred to customer service to confirm duplication before deleting either.

**Customer profile Orders tab consolidation (commit `ab216aa`):**
- Removed Cancelled tab (not actionable). Merged Billing tab into Completed.
- Completed tab now renders in billing mode: checkboxes, Paid/Outstanding badges, Bill Orders + Print Invoice actions inline.
- Tabs: Scheduled · Active · Completed (was: Scheduled · Active · Completed · Cancelled · Billing).

### Apr 1, 2026 (session 89) — Stat cards fix, commercial accounts, overview UX

**⚠️ CRITICAL BUG FIX — Orders stat cards showing wrong numbers (commits `8293b73`, `f0cd6c9`, `384f581`):**
- David noticed Revenue Today ($503.70) didn't match Stripe ($4,181.80). Every stat card was wrong.
- Root cause: Supabase PostgREST enforces a server-side max of 1,000 rows per request. `loadOrders()` fetched all orders with no pagination — once the table exceeded 1,000 rows (now at 1,250), the newest ~250 orders were silently dropped. All stat cards (Picked Up Today, Delivered Today, Processing, Ready, $ In Process, Revenue Today) were calculated from truncated data.
- The numbers were accurate last week because total orders were under 1,000 then.
- Fix: Replaced single query with paginated fetch (same pattern as `loadCustomers`) — fetches in batches of 1,000 using `.range()` until all rows are retrieved.
- **⚠️ WARNING: Supabase default max-rows is 1,000.** Any query that could return >1,000 rows MUST use pagination with `.range()`. The `.limit()` client method does NOT override the server cap. Other queries at risk (health checks at lines ~5369-5400) are currently safe due to status filters but should be monitored as data grows.

**Commercial accounts billing fix (DB update, 22 rows):**
- All recently created commercial accounts (16 Kidango locations + Soul Sanctuary, Russell Moore, Extended Stay America, Reup Refill Shop, Nit Pixies, Fitnesse Training Club) were set to `billing_type: 'automatic'` / `payment_method: 'credit_card'` instead of `billing_type: 'on_account'` / `payment_method: 'check'`.
- Updated all 22 to correct values. Charlotte Maxwell Clinic was already correct.
- Pricelist is driven by `customer_type` field (not a separate pricelist column on customers). `customer_type = 'commercial'` → Commercial pricelist services.

**COMMERCIAL route template window change (DB update):**
- Commercial pickups weren't showing on MAP view because the template had `window_start: 12:00 PM` (PM slot only). When driver Javier arrived early, the AM-defaulting MAP hid the route.
- Changed `window_start` from `12:00` to `09:00` so COMMERCIAL route shows in AM slot. Window is now 9:00 AM – 3:00 PM.

**Overview page UX improvements (commits from session 88, pushed this session):**
- Unpaid Delivered Orders section made collapsible (collapsed by default)
- Added "Requires Rescheduling" section showing orders from Issues tab that need admin action
- Simplified color palette: black headers, neutral badges (except unpaid total stays red, reschedule count red)
- New Customers + Recent Orders moved from Overview to Reports page
- Multi-select checkboxes added to Requires Rescheduling table with same batch actions as Orders page

**Still pending:**
- Annie Reid order #1021 ($187.95) — delivered, has Visa 4686, never charged. Awaiting go-ahead.

### Mar 30, 2026 (session 82) — Fix confusing order_confirmed SMS + same-day double-booking guard

**Root cause investigation — Gina Ecolino wrong SMS:**
- David reported: customer had order #1142 in "Processing" with delivery on Mar 31, but received an SMS saying "Your pickup... is scheduled for Tuesday Mar 31 between 7am–9am."
- Investigation found: the SMS was NOT about order #1142. It was triggered by order #1211 — a brand-new pickup Gina booked herself via the customer app at 2:39pm on Mar 30, for pickup Mar 31 7-9am.
- The confirmation SMS was technically correct for #1211. The confusion arose because (a) the template never mentioned the delivery date, making it look like a status message rather than a new booking confirmation, and (b) the customer app didn't warn Gina that she already had a delivery coming on the same morning.
- "Keeps happening" because ANY customer who books a new order while a prior order is in processing gets an ambiguous "pickup" SMS with no delivery context.

**Fix 1 — `order_confirmed` SMS template updated (DB only, no deploy needed):**
- Old: `"Thank you, {{first_name}}! Your pickup at {{address}} is scheduled for {{pickup_date}} between {{time_window}}."`
- New: `"Thank you, {{first_name}}! Your pickup at {{address}} is confirmed for {{pickup_date}} between {{time_window}}. Expected back by {{delivery_date}}."`
- Adding the delivery date makes it unambiguously a new order confirmation — customers and admins can tell it apart from a status/reminder SMS at a glance.

**Fix 2 — Same-day delivery conflict check added to customer app booking flow:**
- Before inserting the new order, the app now queries the customer's active orders (`status IN ('scheduled', 'processing')`) and checks if any have a delivery on the same calendar day (PT timezone) as the selected pickup date.
- If a conflict is found, a `confirm()` dialog warns: *"You already have a delivery scheduled for [date] (Order #XXXX). Do you still want to book a new pickup for the same day?"*
- Customer can cancel or proceed. Non-blocking — if the DB check throws, booking proceeds normally.
- Location: `customer-app/index.html`, right before the `db.from('orders').insert(...)` call in the `placeOrder()` function.

- **Commit:** `c4927d5` — `Fix confusing order_confirmed SMS and prevent accidental same-day double-bookings`

**Housekeeping — DB cleanup + security fix:**

- **Keith Walewski order #1175 deleted:** Exact duplicate of order #1174 (same pickup/delivery windows, bags, amount — booked 12 minutes apart via customer app). Both route stops (pickup + delivery, both pending) deleted first, then order deleted. Order #1174 is the canonical order and remains.

- **Russ/Russalynne Griggs — duplicate accounts merged:** Two accounts for the same person (same phone: 409-599-4087). Old account `7908375a` (name: "Russ", 2022, 9 orders in old system, no email). New account `2d756ba7` (name: "Russalynne", registered Mar 28 2026 via customer app, no orders). Merged: updated old account → `first_name_cache = 'Russalynne'`, `email_cache = 'russalynnegriggs@gmail.com'`. Deleted new duplicate. Two orphaned auth users (phone + email, both created Mar 28) remain in auth.users but have no customer FK — customer app matches by phone/email lookup so they'll resolve correctly on next login.

- **Sara Allan — RESOLVED, no action needed:** Only one account exists (`152df40e`, 191 orders, `sara@wastewhat.org`, phone `(917) 526-0259`, created 2022). The migration session correctly identified a phone collision and did NOT create a duplicate. The existing account is the canonical record. Carry-forward item closed.

- **`draft-reply` security — fixed:** Edge function was `verify_jwt: false`, allowing unauthenticated callers to burn Anthropic API credits. Fix: admin dashboard `draftSMSReply()` now calls `db.auth.getSession()` and passes `session.access_token` as the Authorization header (throws if session missing). Edge function redeployed as **v7** with `verify_jwt: true`. Only logged-in admins can invoke it now.

- **Commit:** `d876a22` — `fix(security): draft-reply now requires valid admin session JWT`

**Commercial intake — multi-layer bug fix (admin-dashboard/index.html):**

Root cause investigation triggered by screenshot showing: (1) Commercial Wash & Fold appearing as an add-on button, (2) $1.75/bag pricing instead of $1.75/lb, (3) all Delivery pricelist add-ons visible to Commercial customers, (4) Vinegar/Oxi chips charging via saved customer preferences even when hidden in UI.

- **Bug 1 — Wrong service shown as add-on:**
  `allAddonServicesCache` fetches ALL active services (no `is_addon` filter) but is misleadingly named. The `relevantAddons` filter was missing an `s.is_addon &&` guard, so the Commercial Wash & Fold service (which has `is_addon=false`) was appearing as a tappable add-on button in the intake panel.
  Fix: added `s.is_addon &&` to the `relevantAddons` filter in `renderIntakePanel()`.
  **Commit:** `ca01e30`

- **Bug 2 — `procSvc` always pointed to the Delivery service:**
  `saveOrder()` always defaulted to the Delivery service when assigning `procSvc`, even for Commercial orders. Two fixes: (a) `onOrderCustomerChange()` now auto-selects the correct base service when the customer is changed in the New Order modal (Commercial → Commercial service, residential → Delivery service); (b) `openIntakePanel()` now overrides `procSvc` with the Commercial service when `pricelist === 'Commercial'`, and updates the intake subtitle accordingly.

- **Bug 3 — Pricing math treated per_lb as per_bag:**
  `calcProcTotal()` always did `bags × base_price` regardless of `pricing_type`. For Commercial ($1.75/lb) this meant: 10 lbs in 1 bag = $1.75 instead of $17.50.
  Fix: added `isPerLb = svc.pricing_type === 'per_lb'` branch. Per-lb: `weight × rate`, no overage. Per-bag: existing `bags × rate + overage` logic unchanged.
  `renderBreakdownRows()` now shows `"X lbs × $1.75/lb"` for per_lb and `"X bags × $59.00"` for per_bag.
  The overage hint (`"Up to N lbs/bag — overage billed at $X/lb"`) is hidden for per_lb orders.

- **Bug 4 — Delivery add-ons visible to Commercial customers:**
  `renderIntakePanel()` was showing all preference groups (WASH temp, Vinegar/Oxi, Double Wash, etc.) regardless of pricelist. Commercial customers should see no preference-based add-ons.
  Fix: `regularPrefs` and `addonPrefsArr` are set to `[]` when `isPerLb` is true, so no preference sections render for Commercial.

- **Bug 5 — Cross-pricelist preference billing (edge case):**
  Even after hiding chips in the UI, a Commercial customer who previously set preferences via the customer app would still have those preferences trigger charges in `calcProcTotal()` (via `prefLinkedSvc_total`) and appear in `renderBreakdownRows()` (Vinegar × 1 bag, Oxi × 1 bag).
  Fix: added `currentPricelist` variable (`isPerLb ? 'Commercial' : 'Delivery'`) and a pricelist guard in both `calcProcTotal()` and `renderBreakdownRows()`. Any preference-linked service whose `pricelist` column doesn't match the active pricelist (and isn't `'Both'`) is skipped entirely — no charge, no display row.

- **Commits:** `6c6776d` — `fix(intake): correct per-lb pricing and clean up Commercial intake UI`
  `5bb192f` — `fix(intake): skip Delivery preference-linked services for Commercial orders`

- **Commit:** `fa65dc0` — pushed ✅

### Apr 1, 2026 (session 87) — Morning rounds + billing_status backfill

**Daily audit completed (10 checks).** System is mostly healthy.

**P1 — Stop/order desync (fixed):**
- Kathrine Long #944 (skipped) — 2 pending stops set to skipped
- Elizabeth Gettinger #1126 (skipped) — 2 pending stops set to skipped

**P1 — billing_status backfill (15 orders, $1,334.20):**
- 15 delivered orders had `stripe_payment_intent_id` and `billed_at` set (confirmed paid in Stripe) but `billing_status` was NULL — showing as unpaid on the dashboard
- Root cause: batch-charge-retry.js (session 83) ran against charge-order **v30**, which set `billed_at` but not `billing_status`. v31 was deployed later in that session and fixed this for future charges. One-time historical gap.
- Backfilled all 15 to `billing_status = 'paid'`. No more orders with stripe PI + NULL billing_status.

**Billing investigation findings:**
- Dagny Brown #1244 — "Request card" display is correct (no card, no Stripe customer, charge failed Mar 31). No display bug.
- David Glasebrook #774 — has Visa 4389 on file but card was declined Mar 31 (same card that was already there). Dashboard correctly shows "Update card".
- Annie Reid #1021 ($187.95) — delivered, has Visa 4686, Stripe customer set up, but was never charged. No payment intent exists. Chargeable — awaiting David's go-ahead.
- Remaining unpaid: 29 orders, $3,467.55 (21 failed + 8 null with no card)

**Ongoing from prior audits (not actioned):**
- Oakland routes consistently over 18-stop capacity (7 routes this week, 21–26 stops each)
- 15 driverless routes next 7 days (COMMERCIAL, Concord AM, Alameda, Kidango, Berkeley AM)
- Re-Up Refills / Reup Refill Shop — still a merge candidate (share info@wastewhat.org)
- Caragh England #905 vs #1296 — duplicate orders for 3/31, not investigated yet

---

### Mar 31, 2026 (session 86) — Kidango Toyon Center, commercial 4/1 orders, laptop layout, geocoding

**Kidango — Toyon Center added:**
- New customer: Kidango - Toyon Center (id: `0fe2c007-45e7-46e8-92d1-f5083fa0d5a1`)
- Address: 995 Bard Street, San Jose, CA 95127 (id: `27afbdf6-39c1-41eb-8dd7-071a13419dce`)
- 5 weekly orders created: #1451–1455 (Apr 2, 9, 16, 23, 30), Thu pickup → Fri delivery

**3 recurring commercial orders for 4/1 (Wed):**
- #1456 Kasa Hotel Addison, #1457 Kasa Hotels La Monarca, #1458 Homebase Shelter Program
- All on COMMERCIAL route, Wed pickup 12–3 PM PT → same-day delivery

**Laptop-optimized admin dashboard layout (2 commits):**
- `9f7b56c` — Scrollable route chip strip with fade-gradient scroll arrows; chips auto-hide arrows when content fits
- `ccb3a14` — Sidebar narrowed 20% (`--sidebar-w: 175px`), logo/nav/footer padding tightened, orders table restructured from 10→8 columns using combined pickup/delivery cells with compact date/time formatters (`fmtDateShort`, `fmtTimeShort`, `fmtSlotShort`), `table-layout:fixed`, laptop media query at ≤1440px

**Commercial address geocoding:**
- All 21 commercial customer addresses geocoded with lat/lng for Leaflet map display
- 3 addresses corrected after accuracy audit: Homebase Shelter (633 Hegenberger Rd), USS Hornet (707 W Hornet Ave), Kasa Addison (2263 Sacramento St)

**Git note:** Laptop layout commits were blocked by `.git/HEAD.lock` in sandbox. David removed lock files and pushed from his terminal. Both commits (`9f7b56c`, `ccb3a14`) confirmed pushed to main.

### Mar 31, 2026 (session 85) — Commercial route templates + Starchup customer migration

**Goal:** Create two commercial route templates (Kidango and COMMERCIAL), import all recurring commercial customers from Starchup, and populate April orders.

**Route templates created:**
- **Kidango** — Thu/Fri, 7–11 AM, 4-hour arrival window. Template ID: `d6a6db9c-98ba-4133-8893-99d702abdb52`
- **COMMERCIAL** — Mon–Sat, 12–3 PM, 3-hour arrival window. Template ID: `94d436c4-fea5-41c9-8ba6-654082f455e2`
- Both assigned to **"Commercial" service zone** (ID: `914d20f4-9978-46fd-a13d-a5111c217d73`) — an empty zone with no polygon/cities/city_polygons, so routes never appear in the customer booking flow. All scheduling is admin-only.

**Customers imported (21 total):**
- **15 Kidango locations** (new accounts): Hillside, Ryan, Unidos, Cesar Chavez, CCELC, Hubbard Center, Meadowfair, Shilling Center, Coyote Hills, Searles, Kitayama, Colonial Acres, Lorenzo Manor, Bay, Dayton. All weekly Thu pickup → Fri delivery. All addresses and delivery instructions migrated from Starchup.
- **4 existing commercial accounts updated:** Homebase Shelter Program, Kasa Hotel Addison, Kasa Hotels La Monarca, Extended Stay America Emeryville/Oakland. Added missing addresses to Homebase, Kasa Addison, and Kasa La Monarca. Updated all to `customer_type = 'commercial'`.
- **2 new commercial accounts:** Russell Moore (USS Hornet, weekly Fri), Soul Sanctuary 1888 MLK (Tue/Thu/Sat).

**Orders created: 145 scheduled orders, April 2–30:**
- 15 Kidango locations × 5 weeks = 75 orders
- Homebase (Mon/Wed/Fri) = 12, Kasa Addison (Mon/Wed/Fri) = 12, Kasa La Monarca (Mon/Tue/Wed/Fri) = 16
- Extended Stay (Tue/Thu/Sat) = 13, Soul Sanctuary (Tue/Thu/Sat) = 13, Russell Moore (weekly Fri) = 4
- **0 routing errors** — auto_route_on_insert trigger handled all route creation and stop assignment
- All orders use `source = 'scheduled'`, `zone_id = '914d20f4...'` (Commercial zone)

**Preflight safety check passed:** Verified no SMS sent (all commercial customers have `sms_consent_at = NULL`). No customer_registered or order_confirmed SMS fired.

**Data source:** David's uploaded "Orders Feb 26.xlsx" — used to extract addresses, recurring day patterns, and delivery instructions for all commercial customers.

**Recurring day patterns (from Starchup data):**
- Homebase, Kasa Addison: Mon/Wed/Fri (schedule_days 0,2,4)
- Kasa La Monarca: Mon/Tue/Wed/Fri (0,1,2,4)
- Extended Stay, Soul Sanctuary: Tue/Thu/Sat (1,3,5)
- Russell Moore: Fri (4)
- All Kidango: Thu (3) pickup, Fri (4) delivery

### Mar 30, 2026 (session 84) — Morning rounds audit + route/data cleanup

**Full 10-check audit completed.** Results and fixes below.

**P0 — Route fixes (5 orders):**
- **Hannah Rosen #317** — Was completely unrouted (no stops). Created pickup stop on Mar 31 Berkeley AM + delivery stop on Apr 1 Berkeley PM.
- **Devki Patel #1102** — Was completely unrouted (no stops). Created pickup stop on Mar 31 Oakland AM + delivery stop on Apr 1 Oakland PM.
- **Shane Ruiz #1107** — `rescheduled_no_capacity` error, stops were 2 days late (pickup Apr 3, delivery Apr 4). Moved pickup to Apr 1 Oakland AM, delivery to Apr 2 Oakland PM. Cleared `routing_error`.
- **Anita Reeding #1122** — Delivery stop was on same route/date as pickup (Mar 30 Hayward PM) — would have attempted same-day delivery. Moved delivery to Mar 31 Hayward PM, reset status to pending.
- **Melissa Boldridge #889** — Delivery on Apr 1 Berkeley PM but delivery window is Mar 31 Pacific. Moved to Mar 31 Berkeley PM.

**P0 — Cancelled order cleanup (4 orders, 8 stops):**
- Stacy Kawula #391, Viktoria Kovacs #891, Anders Woodruff #1075, Selena Bowie #1148 — all cancelled orders still had pending pickup + delivery stops on active routes. Set all 8 stops to `skipped`.

**P1 — Duplicate order resolution:**
- **Wyn Lee #434 vs #1203:** #434 was auto-scheduled ($0.00, source `scheduled`), #1203 was customer-placed ($71.95, source `customer_app`) — same pickup date Apr 1. Cancelled #434 and skipped its stops. #1203 is the real order.
- **Nit Pixies #730 vs #1179:** Both already picked up and `ready_for_delivery` with different amounts ($48.95 recurring vs $68.95 scheduled). Two legitimate orders — no action needed.

**P1 — SMS consent backfill:**
- 16 customers had `phone_cache` set but `sms_consent_at = NULL` and `sms_marketing_opt_out_at = NULL`. Backfilled `sms_consent_at` to each customer's `created_at` timestamp. Gap is now 0.

**Audit items still on radar (not urgent):**
- 8 over-capacity routes (Oakland AM/PM, Mar 31–Apr 4)
- 11 driverless routes next 7 days (Alameda PM, Concord AM, Berkeley AM)
- 1 duplicate account pair: Re-Up Refills / Reup Refill Shop (both share `info@wastewhat.org`)
- 18 duplicate addresses, 236 orphan profiles (DB housekeeping)
- Briana Berger #869 (`scheduled`, no active pickup stop) — may need re-routing
- McEvoy ($89.95) and Petrie ($68.95) — Stripe-declined, may need manual follow-up

---

### Mar 31, 2026 (session 83) — charge-order bug fix, billing recovery, customer outreach

**Root cause:** `charge-order` edge function (v28/v29) had a `CHARGEABLE_STATUSES` whitelist `['ready_for_delivery', 'out_for_delivery', 'delivered']`. The dashboard fires the charge call *before* updating the DB status, so the DB still showed `folding` or `rack` at charge time — not in the whitelist — causing silent failure and `billing_status = 'failed'` for every rack-stage charge. Customers with valid cards were being marked as failed and receiving payment_failed SMS unnecessarily.

**Fix — `charge-order` v31** (`supabase/functions/charge-order/index.ts`):
- Replaced `CHARGEABLE_STATUSES` whitelist with `NON_CHARGEABLE_STATUSES` blacklist: `['scheduled', 'on_hold', 'cancelled', 'skipped', 'pickup_failed']`
- Also fixed accidental `verify_jwt: true` from v30 (dashboard uses `apikey` header, not a JWT — broke all charges silently)

**Three failure groups identified (61 total orders, $5,498.55):**
- **Group A** (1 customer, $68.95): No `stripe_customer_id` — Lodestar Campus (commercial). Ignored.
- **Group B** (27 customers, $2,943.50): Has Stripe ID but no card in `customer_payment_methods`. Genuinely no card on file.
- **Group C** (33 customers, $2,486.10): Has Stripe ID + card — failed purely due to the whitelist bug.

**Group C batch retry** (`batch-charge-retry.js`): 31/33 succeeded — **$2,327.15 recovered**. 2 still declined by Stripe (Jacqueline McEvoy #281 $89.95, James Petrie #369 $68.95 — card-level declines, not a code issue).

**Group B outreach** (`outreach-sms.js`, `outreach-email.js`):
- Browser console scripts that live-query the DB to find customers with unpaid orders and no card on file (non-commercial, deduped by customer).
- Message directs customers to add payment at app.familylaundry.com.
- **Results: 27/27 SMS sent (0 failed), 26/26 emails sent (1 skipped — no email on file)**. McEvoy and Petrie correctly excluded (they have cards, just Stripe-declined — different problem).
- Scripts are reusable — re-running always reflects current DB state and won't message customers who've since added cards.

**Outstanding:**
- McEvoy ($89.95) and Petrie ($68.95) have valid cards that Stripe is declining. May need manual follow-up or to ask them to update their card.
- Group B customers ($2,943.50) have been contacted. Watch for card additions over the next few days and re-run `batch-charge-retry.js` against any newly added cards.

- **Commit:** `fa65dc0` — `fix(billing): patch charge-order status guard, retry failed charges, outreach to 27 customers`

---

### Mar 30, 2026 (session 81) — Skip action cards, draft usage tracking, route fixes

- **Jon Patchen order #1165 — route fix:**
  - `routing_error = 'rescheduled_no_capacity'` flag was still set even though his pickup stop was correctly placed on Oakland AM Mar 30. Cleared the flag.
  - Delivery stop was on Oakland PM Mar 30 (wrong date — delivery should be Mar 31). Moved to Oakland PM Mar 31 route.

- **Briana Berger order #869 — route fix:**
  - Both stops were one day late. Pickup moved from Alameda PM Mar 31 → Mar 30. Delivery moved from Alameda PM Apr 1 → Mar 31.
  - Fix was via `UPDATE route_stops SET route_id = <correct_route>, driver_id = <route_driver>` targeting both stops by their order_id + stop type.

- **Inbox automation — skip action cards (admin dashboard + `draft-reply` v4):**
  - When the AI detects a `skip_request` intent and the customer has an upcoming recurring order, the edge function now returns a structured `action` object alongside the draft: `{ type, order_id, order_number, pickup_label, label, confirmation_draft }`.
  - Admin dashboard renders an animated action card above the compose box. Clicking **✓ Confirm** skips the order in the DB (`status → skipped`, `cancelled_by → customer`) and pre-fills the compose box with a ready-to-send confirmation message. Admin always sends manually — nothing auto-sends.
  - `_pendingInboxAction` module variable holds the pending action (never serialized into `onclick` — XSS-safe).
  - `confirmInboxAction()` calls `logOrderEvent()` before the DB write to maintain order history (matching the `opSkipOrder` pattern). Refreshes filter counts and order list after skip.
  - Action card dismissed when conversation switches, send completes, or user clicks ×.
  - Only fires for recurring orders — one-time orders return `action: null`.

- **`draft-reply` v5 — Family Laundry branding fix:**
  - System prompt, voice section header, and conversation history role labels were all using "WashRoute" (internal tooling name). Renamed throughout to "Family Laundry" (the customer-facing brand).
  - "WashRoute" in this codebase refers to the admin software, not the business name.

- **`draft_events` table — draft usage tracking (migration + `draft-reply` v6):**
  - New table `draft_events` (columns: `id`, `created_at`, `admin_profile_id` FK→profiles, `customer_id` FK→customers, `phone`, `intent`, `mode`, `action_type`). Indexes on `admin_profile_id`, `customer_id`, `created_at DESC`. RLS enabled — `SELECT` for authenticated admins/managers/laundry_techs only.
  - `draft-reply` v6: accepts `admin_profile_id` in the request body, fire-and-forget logs one row per draft to `draft_events`. Never blocks the response.
  - Admin dashboard `draftSMSReply()` passes `admin_profile_id: currentUserId || null` in the fetch body. Enables per-admin usage reports (who uses AI draft, how often, which intents).
  - Motivation: CloudPRNT polling buries edge function logs; DB-level tracking is the only reliable way to audit usage.

- **`draft-reply` deployed as v6** (Supabase edge function version 6). All four changes (skip actions, branding fix, usage logging, conversation label fix) are live.

- **Commit:** `3722dd9` — `feat(inbox): skip action cards, draft usage tracking, Family Laundry branding`

- **⚠️ Security — Medium (carry-forward):** `draft-reply` has `verify_jwt: false` with no rate limiting. Add IP-based rate limiting or switch to `verify_jwt: true`.

- **Pending P1 (carry-forward):**
  - Keith Walewski double-booking — delete order #1175
  - Russ/Russalynne Griggs duplicate account — needs merge

- **Low (carry-forward):** Add `is_automated` boolean to `sms_messages` for cleaner voice example filtering in `draft-reply` (currently uses heuristic body pattern exclusion).

---

### Mar 30, 2026 (session 80) — AI draft reply: generate + refine modes, intent detection, real voice examples

- **`draft-reply` edge function (v1 → v3):** New Supabase edge function powers AI-assisted SMS reply drafting from the admin inbox. Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` Supabase secret (David added during session). Uses Claude Haiku for speed.
- **Generate mode:** When compose box is empty, detects customer intent from last inbound message (8 categories: `pricing_inquiry`, `reschedule_request`, `status_check`, `payment_issue`, `complaint`, `cancellation`, `skip_request`, `new_order`). Fetches conversation history (last 20 messages), 2 most recent orders, and 8 real admin-sent voice examples from `sms_messages` (de-duplicated, filtered to exclude automated templates). Calls Claude with intent-specific drafting guidance.
- **Refine mode:** When compose box has text, passes `current_draft` to edge function. Claude polishes grammar, clarity, and tone while preserving all admin-specified details (names, times, addresses, amounts). Button label changes to "…refining" to signal the mode.
- **Admin dashboard — ✦ Draft button:** Added left of Send button in inbox composer (`inbox-composer-actions` wrapper). CSS: ghost style, blue on hover. JS `draftSMSReply()` reads compose box content to select mode, calls edge function, populates textarea, focuses cursor at end for immediate editing. Admin always clicks Send manually — nothing auto-sends.
- **Voice grounding:** Edge function fetches last 60 outbound messages, filters automated templates by body patterns, de-duplicates, takes 8 most recent unique human-written replies as few-shot examples in the system prompt. Updates automatically as admin sends more messages.
- **Commit:** `a844a35` — `feat: AI draft reply button in SMS inbox` (v1 of feature, before refine/intent improvements). Refine + intent improvements deployed directly to edge function v3 (no additional commit yet — pending push).
- **Next:** Consider intent-based action cards (e.g., reschedule request surfaces a one-click reschedule action alongside the draft reply). Draft scoring/logging to track what admins change over time.
- **⚠️ Security — Medium (carry-forward):** `draft-reply` has `verify_jwt: false` with no rate limiting. Unauthenticated callers can burn Anthropic API credits. Add IP-based rate limiting or switch to `verify_jwt: true` (requires admin session token in header).

- **Old-app customer migration — 22 registrants scanned, 13 new accounts created:**
  - Pulled the 22-person registrant list from the old Family Laundry system. Scanned each against the new DB by last 10 digits of phone + `email_cache`.
  - 9 already had accounts (matched by phone or email). 1 flagged as collision risk (Sara Allan — same phone as 2022 account with different email, not touched, carry-forward).
  - 13 new customer accounts created via direct DB insert with `referral_source`, `address_cache`, `access_instructions`, and `notes` fields populated from old-system data.
  - 3 address patches applied to existing customers whose records lacked address data: DJ Rich, Ellen Mulberg, Oscar Delgadillo.
  - Welcome SMS sent to all 13 new accounts via `send-sms` edge function using pg_net: *"Hi [name], welcome to Family Laundry! Book your first pickup at app.familylaundry.com — David"*
  - **N S (Nirmala/initials-only):** Privacy alias email (aleeas.com), initials-only name — account created, privacy flag noted in DB notes field.
  - **Sara Allan carry-forward:** Phone `(917) 526-0259` matched a 2022 account under a different email. Likely same person with old email. Not merged — needs manual investigation before touching.

- **Parker Thomas — missed migration customer, full account + first order created:**
  - Account created with full address (2250 Otis Dr, Alameda CA), driver notes ("Gate code: 1234; Park in driveway"), referral_source = `referral`.
  - Order #1164 scheduled: Monday Mar 31 PM pickup (run `60247823`, Alameda PM route, 18:00–20:00 window), Tuesday Apr 1 PM delivery (run `403e4d01`, 18:00–20:00). Source = `scheduled`, status = `scheduled`, recurring_interval = NULL (one-time).
  - Route stops created for both pickup and delivery legs.
  - Welcome SMS sent: same "Hi Parker, welcome to Family Laundry!" message as the batch above.
  - **Constraint errors resolved during creation:** `orders_source_check` only allows `scheduled/walk_in/customer_app/recurring` (not `admin`); `orders_status_check` does not include `confirmed` (use `scheduled`). Both were hit and corrected — CTE atomicity ensured clean rollback on each attempt.

- **Alameda route reassignment clarification:** With no dedicated Alameda driver for Monday PM, individual stops will be reassigned to other routes via drag-and-drop in RCC. Confirmed that reassignment only updates `route_stop.route_id` — order pickup/delivery windows are NOT changed by drag-and-drop. PM→PM reassignment is safe: customers receive the same window SMS they booked. Cross-window reassignment (e.g., PM stop onto AM route) would require Reschedule modal to keep SMS accurate.

- **QA run (end of session):** No high-severity issues. Medium: `draft-reply` rate limiting (noted above). Low: voice example filter is heuristic-based (body pattern exclusion) — consider adding `is_automated` boolean to `sms_messages` for cleaner filtering in a future session.

- **Commit:** Session 80 changes were bundled into the session 81 commit (`3722dd9`). Push from `~/Projects/WashRoute` when ready: `git push`

### Mar 15, 2026 (session 12) — Processing intake UX + order data sync fixes

- **Standardized intake panel button sizes (commit `6064ad7`):** All `.proc-addon-btn` buttons now have a fixed `width: 120px; box-sizing: border-box` so Customer Add-on chips (Vinegar, Oxi) and Service add-on buttons (Air Dry, Shirt Service) are identical in size. Each service card is wrapped in a `120px` flex-column container so the QTY stepper (`− 1 +`) is constrained to that same width and can't overflow. Removed the "Qty" label from steppers — the `−` / `+` controls are self-explanatory.

- **Admin Details tab now shows actual line_items from processing (commit `6064ad7`):** `opRecalcEstimate()` previously recalculated from scratch (bags × price + delivery + same-day) and ignored any add-on services or overage charges saved during processing intake. It now pulls all extra line items from `o.line_items` (types `addon_service`, `addon`, `overage`) and displays them alongside the live-calculated base/fees. Total label changes from "Estimated Total" → "Total" once real processed data is present. Base bag count and same-day toggle are still live-editable.

- **Realtime handler refreshes Details and Billing tabs (commit `6064ad7`):** When the processing queue saves updated `total_amount` and `line_items` to the DB, Supabase Realtime fires an UPDATE event. The admin realtime handler now calls `opRecalcEstimate()` and `opPopulateBilling()` when the open order panel matches — so charges appear instantly without requiring a panel close/reopen.

- **Fixed duplicate "Yes" rows in processing intake breakdown (commit `f6a3e3e`):** `renderBreakdownRows()` was emitting both a `price_mod` row (label "Yes") and a linked service row ("Vinegar × 2 bags") for the same preference, causing duplicate charges. `calcProcTotal()` was also double-counting these. Fixed both: any preference group that has a linked service in `allAddonServicesCache` now skips the `price_mod` line — only the linked service line (with correct bag × price calculation) appears.

- **Fixed `procIsSameDay` and `opIsSameDay` same-day detection (commit `f6a3e3e`):** Both the admin order panel and the processing intake were using `.slice(0,10)` on UTC timestamps to compare pickup vs delivery dates. This fails for PM slots (e.g., 6pm Pacific = 01:00 UTC next day — UTC date shows wrong day). Fixed both to use `toLocaleDateString('en-CA', { timeZone: BIZ_TZ })` for accurate Pacific-time date comparison.

- **Fixed order data sync across views (commit `15f89eb`):** Processing queue's `loadProcessing()` was missing key fields from its SELECT — `pickup_window_start`, `delivery_window_start`, `total_amount`, `line_items` — so `procIsSameDay` was always false and same-day surcharges were never applied during intake. Added those fields. `openIntakePanel()` now fresh-fetches the order from DB on panel open and patches the cache with the live data. Customer app detail screen now re-renders in-place via `openDetail()` when a realtime order update fires while that order is open.

- **Next session priorities:**
  1. ~~Receipt printing~~ ✅ Done session 13
  2. Add `price_mod` for Double Wash and remaining add-on prefs
  3. ~~Twilio A2P 10DLC registration~~ ✅ Approved 2026-03-16

### Mar 15, 2026 (session 13) — Thermal receipt printing + intake UX polish

- **Thermal receipt printing — 2 copies auto-print on intake save (commit `58f8a18`):** `_openReceiptWindow(data, copies, win)` builds a full 80mm thermal receipt: business header, customer name + address, order # + "2 BAGS · 27 LBS", schedule box with pickup/delivery dates and Stop · Route (fetched from `route_stops` joined to `routes`), add-on tags section (bordered chips from `addon_service` line items), invoice section (filtered to `base`/`overage`/`addon_service` types only — raw "Yes"/"Hot" `addon` items excluded), subtotal/delivery fee/credit breakdown, Amount Due in large type, CODE128 barcode via JsBarcode CDN. Two copies rendered side-by-side (screen) / separated by `page-break-after: always` (print).

- **Popup blocking fix:** `window.open()` is called *before* any `await` in `saveIntake()` so browsers don't block it as a non-gesture popup. The pre-opened window reference is passed through `_autoPrintIntake(lineItems, bd, printWin)` → `_openReceiptWindow()`. If the DB save fails, the orphaned window is closed via `printWin.close()`. The order panel 🖨 Print button (`printBagTag()`) opens the popup synchronously before its async route stop query. If popups are blocked by browser settings, a toast is shown.

- **Receipt line item filtering:** Only `base`, `overage`, `addon_service` types appear in the invoice body. `delivery_fee`, `same_day_surcharge`, and `credit` types appear as their own totals rows below. This eliminates the "Yes"/"Hot" noise from `addon` items that previously inflated receipts.

- **Receipt weight display:** Format is "2 BAGS · 27 LBS" — bags first (more natural), weight always shown (falls back to "— LBS" if not yet recorded).

- **Special instructions in intake panel (commit `58f8a18`):** `renderIntakePanel()` now renders a "Special Instructions" textarea between the add-on prefs and price breakdown sections. Pre-filled from `procNotes` (loaded from `order.special_instructions` on panel open — same DB field the customer fills in at booking). Editable before save; changes persist to `special_instructions` on the order. `procNotes` is updated via `oninput` so re-renders (triggered by bag/weight/addon changes) preserve any edits.

- **Weight displayed across admin views (commit `58f8a18`):** Orders table "Bags" column now shows bag count bold + lbs in grey below (e.g. **2** / 27 lbs) when weight is available. Order panel Details tab gains a read-only "Weight" row (hidden until the order has been weighed at intake) displayed below the editable "Bags" input. Customer panel order rows already showed weight via `cpOrderMeta()` — no change needed.

- **Next session priorities:**
  1. ~~Email receipt fixes~~ ✅ Done session 14
  2. ~~Kanban reprint button~~ ✅ Done session 14
  3. Add `price_mod` for Double Wash and remaining add-on prefs
  4. ~~Twilio A2P 10DLC registration~~ ✅ Approved 2026-03-16
  5. SMS/email automation Phase 1 — status check auto-replies ("Where's my driver?")

---

### Mar 15, 2026 (session 14) — Email receipt fixes + kanban reprint buttons

- **Email receipt auto-sent on intake save (commit `fb808eb`):** `saveIntake()` now fires a fire-and-forget `fetch` to `send-receipt` edge function immediately after the DB save succeeds. Uses the already-captured `movedId` (safe — `closeIntakePanel()` runs after, so `procActiveOrder` is still valid when the ID is captured). Silent fail: if the customer has no email or SendGrid fails, it logs a warning and doesn't block the intake flow.

- **Email receipt — YES/YES noise fixed + weight added (`send-receipt` edge function v12):** `buildEmailHtml()` now filters `chargeItems` to only `base`, `overage`, `addon_service`, `delivery_fee`, `same_day_surcharge` types — same logic as the print receipt fix from session 13. Raw `addon` preference labels ("Yes", "Hot", etc.) are excluded. Also added `total_bags` and `weight_lbs` to the Supabase select, with a compact "2 bags · 27.0 lbs" summary line shown just below the receipt number.

- **`printBagTag()` accepts optional orderId for kanban reprints (commit `fb808eb`):** Signature changed to `printBagTag(overrideOrderId)`. When called with an ID, looks up the order across all caches (`allOrders`, `allCleanOrders`, `allFoldOrders`, `allProcOrders`). Falls back to `allCustomers` lookup first, then uses embedded `o.customers` join data — needed because kanban caches don't include `customer_id` as a top-level field (only the nested join). Route stop query also uses `targetId` instead of `opCurrentOrderId`. No-arg calls from the order panel 🖨 Print button are unchanged.

- **🖨 Reprint button on Cleaning + Folding kanban cards (commit `fb808eb`):** Each card in the Cleaning and Folding columns now has a small "🖨 Reprint" link at the bottom-left, alongside the existing "← undo" link on the right. Calls `printBagTag(orderId)` with `event.stopPropagation()` so it doesn't open the fold/rack panel.

- **Next session priorities:**
  1. ~~UX audit + top 5 fixes~~ ✅ Done session 15
  2. Add `price_mod` for Double Wash and remaining add-on prefs
  3. ~~Twilio A2P 10DLC registration~~ ✅ Approved 2026-03-16
  4. SMS/email automation Phase 1 — status check auto-replies ("Where's my driver?")

### Mar 15, 2026 (session 15) — UX audit + 5 high-impact fixes

- **Full UX audit across all 3 apps:** Identified top 5 high-impact issues — duplicate order risk, silent server error, batch button races, low-contrast completed stops, unclear disabled slots.

- **Fix 1 — Customer app: double-tap protection on Place Order (commits `b57c997`, `c99d756`):** `placeOrder()` now disables `#btn-place` and sets text to "Processing…" as the very first line, before any validation. Validation failures re-enable the button with the correct label (logged-in vs guest path). Prevents duplicate order creation on slow connections.

- **Fix 2 — Driver app: `sendOnMyWay()` now checks `res.ok` (commit `b57c997`):** Added `if (!res.ok) throw new Error(...)` immediately after `await res.json()`. Previously, a server 500 would silently treat the "On My Way" notification as sent and advance the driver to Phase 2 — customer was never notified but driver was stuck in "en route" state.

- **Fix 3 — Admin: batch Advance + Delete buttons disabled during async loop (commit `b57c997`):** `batchAdvanceStatus()` and `batchCancelOrders()` now disable both batch buttons (`#batch-advance-btn` and `.batch-bar-btn.danger`) at the start of the operation and re-enable on completion. Prevents double-tap mid-loop which could have fired duplicate DB writes.

- **QA catch — delete button icon destroyed on RPC failure (commit `c99d756`):** `batchCancelOrders()` was setting `_delBtn.textContent = 'Deleting…'` which wiped the SVG trash icon. On RPC error, the batch bar stayed visible with a broken button. Fixed by removing the textContent change — opacity/disabled alone is sufficient feedback.

- **Fix 4 — Driver app: completed stop cards now use background color (commit `b57c997`):** Replaced `.stop-card.done { opacity: 0.55 }` with `background: #f3f4f6; border-color: #d1d5db` and muted text colors on `.stop-name` / `.stop-meta`. Opacity-based dimming was unreadable on mobile in sunlight; background-color change is clearer and more accessible.

- **Fix 5 — Customer app: `sched-opt` disabled state CSS (commit `b57c997`):** Added `.sched-opt:disabled, .sched-opt.unavailable { background: gray-50; color: gray-300; border: gray-100; cursor: not-allowed; text-decoration: line-through }`. Currently slots are pre-filtered and hidden when past cutoff, but this CSS ensures any future "show but disable" behavior renders correctly — and suppresses `:active` tap highlight on disabled slots.

- **How did you find us? — referral source added to customer signup (commit `19453bb`):** Both the standalone signup form and the inline checkout account creation now include a "How did you find us?" dropdown. 10 source options: Nextdoor, Yelp, Google Search, Friend/Family, Instagram, Roots & Soul, Oakland Ballers, I Saw Your Van!, ChatGPT/AI, Other. `ensureProfile()` updated to accept `referralSource` param — sets on new insert; patches orphaned profiles only if they have no existing value. Admin customer panel also updated with matching options for manual entry.

- **All commits this session:** `19453bb`, `b57c997`, `c99d756`

- **Next session priorities:**
  1. ~~Add Double Wash price_mod~~ ✅ Done session 16
  2. ~~SMS automation Phase 1~~ ✅ Done session 16
  3. ~~Twilio A2P 10DLC registration~~ ✅ Approved 2026-03-16

### Mar 16, 2026 (session 25) — Route Command Center (RCC)

- **Route Command Center built into admin dashboard (commit `28c33c1`):** Completely replaced the old zone-pill / AM-PM Order Schedule with a new full-screen interface. The `orders-schedule-view` container is now a flex column: date bar → chip strip (`#rcc-chips`) → workspace (map pane left, columns panel right).

- **Chip strip:** `rccRenderChips()` renders one chip per route template for the selected date. Chips show route color dot, name, time window, and stop count badge. Active chips get the `rcc-on` class + `--rcc-color` CSS variable for per-chip theming. Clicking an inactive chip calls `rccToggleRoute(routeId)` which fetches stops + addresses async and opens the column. Clicking an active chip closes it.

- **Draggable columns:** `rccRenderColumns()` builds one `.rcc-col` per active route. Column header: driver initials avatar (route color background), driver name, route name, P/D/total stop counts, completion progress bar. Column body (`.rcc-body`, scrollable flex) contains `rcc-popin` animated stop cards. Close button (×) at top-right deactivates the route.

- **Stop cards (`rccBuildCard`):** 3-color design: route-colored `.rcc-stop-num` circle (position:absolute left:8px), dark `.rcc-card-name`, gray `.rcc-card-addr` + `.rcc-card-foot`. P/D type badge uses blue tint for pickup, gray for delivery. ✓/✗ status marks for complete/failed/skipped. Click flies map to pin. Hover highlights map pin via existing `highlightStopPin`.

- **Drag-and-drop reassignment:** `rccDragStart` → `rccDragOver` → `rccDrop`. On drop: optimistic local state mutation (splice stop from source, push to dest) → `rccRenderColumns()` + `rccRenderMap()` + `rccRenderChips()` immediately → async DB write (`route_stops.route_id` + `stop_number` + `routes.total_stops` on both) → `autoOptimizeRoute` on both routes → silent error toast if DB write fails.

- **Map:** `rccRenderMap()` clears all `_isStopLayer` layers and redraws polylines + numbered pins for every active route. Colors per route, stop_number shown on pin. Legend overlay (`#rcc-legend`) shown when 2+ routes are open. `rccUpdatePanelWidth()` sets panel width to `min(n × 290px, 55vw)` and calls `routeLiveMap.invalidateSize()` after the CSS transition.

- **Optimize button:** Now calls `optimizeRoute()` which iterates `[..._rccActiveRoutes]` and fires the edge function for each, then calls `rccRefreshRoute` on all. Hidden when no routes are open.

- **`autoOptimizeRoute` updated:** Now checks `_rccActiveRoutes.has(routeId)` instead of `routeLiveRouteId === routeId` and calls `rccRefreshRoute(routeId)` on success.

- **Realtime handler updated:** Stop completion/skip events now call `rccRefreshRoute(stop.route_id)` if the route is open, instead of the old `selectRunOnMap` pattern.

- **QA fixes caught during review:**
  - `display:none;display:flex` double inline style on `orders-schedule-view` — second value always won; `switchOrdersView` setting `style.display = ''` would then show the container as `block` not `flex`. Fixed by removing the inline `display:flex` and updating `switchOrdersView` to set `display = 'flex'`.
  - `min-height:0` added to `.rcc-body` for correct flex overflow scrolling within the column.

- **Commit:** `28c33c1`

- **Next session priorities:**
  1. Test RCC in browser with real data — open 2+ routes, drag a stop, verify DB update + re-optimization
  2. Test CloudPRNT end-to-end with physical printer on-site
  3. Xero accounting sync (backlog)

### Mar 18, 2026 (session 35d) — Driver stop ordering fix, map polyline fix, QA/security hardening

- **Bug fix — driver app showed stops in wrong order:**
  - **Problem:** The driver app displayed stops sorted by `stop_number` (DB insertion order), not by pickup/delivery window time. This caused 8–10 PM stops to appear above 6–8 PM stops, confusing drivers about which stop to do first.
  - **Fix:** Added `sortStopsByWindow()` helper that sorts stops by their pickup or delivery window start timestamp, then assigns sequential `_displayNum` values. Replaced all 7 `stop_number` sorts in the driver app with `_displayNum`-based sorting. Called after `loadDriverData()` address enrichment and in `renderRoute()`.
  - **File:** `driver-app/index.html`
- **Bug fix — RCC map polylines connecting stops out of order:**
  - **Problem:** Route lines on the Order Schedule map connected stops in wrong sequence (stop 1 → stop 3, skipping stop 2). Same root cause as driver app — polyline coordinate arrays sorted by raw `stop_number`.
  - **Fix:** Changed polyline sort in `rccRenderMap()` to use `(a._displayNum||a.stop_number)` instead of `a.stop_number`, so lines follow the time-window ordering.
  - **File:** `admin-dashboard/index.html` — `rccRenderMap()` function.
- **Security fix — XSS in customer combo filter:**
  - Customer names were injected into innerHTML without escaping in `custComboFilter()`. A malicious name like `<script>alert(1)</script>` could execute. Fixed by wrapping `label` and `phone` values in `esc()` and escaping single quotes in onclick handlers.
  - **File:** `admin-dashboard/index.html` — `custComboFilter()`
- **Validation — bags and service checks in saveOrder():**
  - `saveOrder()` now validates that bags ≥ 1 and that a service ID exists before submitting. Previously could save orders with 0 bags or no service.
  - **File:** `admin-dashboard/index.html` — `saveOrder()`
- **Code quality — DEAD_ORDER_STATUSES consolidated:**
  - Replaced 6 inline copies of the dead-order status list with a single top-level `DEAD_ORDER_STATUSES` constant. Used across schedule grids, route progress banner, RCC, stop count map, and move-stop operations.
  - Also applied ghost-stop filtering to move-stop count queries (previously overcounted available stops on source/target routes).
- **Duplicate driver merge — Davey Crockett:**
  - Two profiles existed (email-based login + phone-based OTP with David's number). Route assigned to phone-based driver record, but email login found different driver record → empty driver app.
  - Fixed via SQL: re-pointed active driver to email profile, deleted empty duplicate driver, deleted orphan phone profile.
- **Files changed:** `admin-dashboard/index.html`, `driver-app/index.html`
- **⚠️ Commit pending:** Changes are staged but the VM can't delete `.git/index.lock`. David must run from terminal:

### Mar 18, 2026 (session 35e) — Fixed send-order-notification edge function (404 bug)

- **Root cause found — `send-order-notification` returning 404 on every call:**
  - **Problem:** The edge function's order query selected `pickup_date` and `delivery_date` — columns that **do not exist** in the `orders` table. The actual columns are `pickup_window_start`, `pickup_window_end`, `delivery_window_start`, `delivery_window_end`. PostgREST returns an error object (not an array) when asked for non-existent columns, so `Array.isArray(orders)` returned `false`, `order` became `null`, and the function returned 404 — "Order not found." This affected all SMS notifications sent via `send-order-notification`: pickup confirmation, delivery confirmation, pickup_failed, and order confirmed.
  - **Fix:** Rewrote the order select clause to use the correct column names. Updated template variable interpolation to map `pickup_date` → `order.pickup_window_start` and `delivery_date` → `order.delivery_window_start`. Added console logging for all key steps (request body, template lookup, order lookup, SMS result).
  - **Edge function:** `send-order-notification` v20 (deployed, `verify_jwt: false`)
  - **Confirmed working:** David tested pickup from the driver app and received the SMS.
- **Debugging steps that led to the fix:**
  - Checked edge function logs — confirmed 404 on v16, v17, v19
  - Previously rewrote function from Supabase JS client to raw REST (v17) — didn't help
  - Deployed debug function with hardcoded order ID — worked (proved service role key and REST calls are fine)
  - Set `verify_jwt: false` (v19) — didn't help
  - Deployed debug function v2 to log request bodies — never received calls (different slug)
  - Finally compared the order `select` clause against the actual `orders` table schema — found the non-existent columns
- **Email vs SMS template disconnect identified (not fixed — informational):**
  - The admin Message Templates panel has email fields (`email_subject`, `email_body`, `email_enabled`) that **nothing reads**. The `send-email` edge function is a generic pass-through that sends whatever HTML body it receives. Email content is built inline in `saveOrder()` in the admin dashboard. Only the SMS fields from `message_templates` are actually used by `send-order-notification`.
- **Still pending:**
  - Admin `saveOrder()` does NOT call `send-order-notification` for the `confirmed` event — only sends HTML email via `send-email`. SMS on order creation needs to be wired up.
  - Clean up `send-order-notification-debug` edge function (no longer needed)
  - Full end-to-end lifecycle test (on my way → picked up → out for delivery → delivered)
  ```
  cd ~/Projects/WashRoute && rm -f .git/index.lock .git/HEAD.lock && git add admin-dashboard/index.html driver-app/index.html PROJECT-NOTES.md && git commit -m "Fix driver app stop ordering, map polyline routing, and QA hardening" && git push
  ```
- **Next session priorities:**
  1. Test full order lifecycle end-to-end as driver (pickup → delivery)
  2. Dedicated Retail POS screen (future — iPad at counter, Retail pricing by transaction not customer)

### Mar 18, 2026 (session 35c) — UTC timezone fix, zones filter, ghost stop lock fix, role filtering

- **CRITICAL BUG FIX — UTC timezone causing routes to lock after 5 PM Pacific (commit `5617793`):**
  - **Problem:** The schedule grid used `date.toISOString().split('T')[0]` for date comparisons. `.toISOString()` returns UTC. After 5 PM Pacific (which is midnight+ UTC), the UTC date rolls forward, making "today" appear as "yesterday" — `isPast = true` — which unconditionally locks all route cells. This meant drivers couldn't be changed for evening routes.
  - **Fix:** Replaced all `toISOString()` date comparisons in the schedule grid with local-time formatting (`getFullYear/getMonth/getDate`) consistent with the existing `today()` helper. Also fixed `weekStartStr`/`weekEndStr` which had the same UTC bug.
  - **Files:** `admin-dashboard/index.html` — both schedule grid render functions (pickup + delivery).
  - **⚠️ RULE — NEVER use `toISOString()` for local date comparisons.** Always use `today()` helper or manual `getFullYear()-getMonth()-getDate()` formatting. `toISOString()` is UTC and will be wrong after 5 PM Pacific. This applies everywhere in the codebase — schedule grids, route queries, banner logic, anywhere a "today" check happens.
- **Bug fix — ghost stops falsely locking route schedule cells (commit `29de54f`):**
  - **Problem:** `todayStopStatus` counted all route stops including those from dead orders (delivered, cancelled, skipped, etc.). Ghost stops made routes appear "complete" even when they had real pending stops, triggering the lock.
  - **Fix:** Added `orders!inner(status)` join to the stop query and filter out stops where the order status is in `DEAD_ORDER` list (`delivered`, `cancelled`, `skipped`, `pickup_failed`, `delivery_failed`, `on_hold`). Same pattern already used in route progress banner fix.
- **Customer Zones filter replaces Routes filter (commit `10875ec`):**
  - Customers page filter dropdown now shows delivery zones (Oakland, Berkeley, Alameda, Hayward, San Francisco) from `service_zones` table instead of route templates.
  - Filters customers by matching their default address city against the zone's `cities` array (case-insensitive).
  - Removed unused `allRoutes` variable and `route_templates` query from `loadCustomers()` — slightly faster page load.
- **account_type separated from customer_type (commit `cdba986`):**
  - Added `account_type` column (individual/business) for reporting purposes. The Individual/Business toggle in the admin New Customer form now saves to `account_type`.
  - `customer_type` (Price List) always defaults to 'Delivery' regardless of account type. Businesses stay on Delivery pricing by default; only manually moved to Commercial on a case-by-case basis.
- **Role filtering across admin dashboard (commit `3a252ec`):**
  - Customer picker (New Order): excludes `driver` and `laundry_tech` roles. Admins who are also customers remain selectable.
  - All Drivers grid + driver cache: excludes `laundry_tech` role.
  - Messages tab: excludes `laundry_tech` from driver list.
- **Service selector removed from New Order (commit `39382ff`):**
  - Hidden input auto-defaults to Wash & Fold (Delivery, $59/bag). Prevents accidentally selecting wrong pricing tier (e.g., Commercial $1.75/bag).
- **Driver Messages fixes (commit `08aae4c`):**
  - Badge: fixed stale unread count showing phantom messages.
  - Driver list: now shows ALL drivers (online + offline) sorted by status, with green/gray dot indicator. Previously only showed online drivers.
- **Customer app — past orders filter (commit `3053d32`):**
  - Past Orders tab only shows `delivered` orders. Cancelled, skipped, and failed orders are hidden from both Active and Past tabs.
- **Route progress banner fix (commit `2bff516`):**
  - Banner excluded ghost stops from dead orders using same `DEAD_ORDER` list. Previously showed inflated "7 stops done" when most were cancelled.
- **Customer app back navigation fix (commit `444a929`):**
  - Changed `showScreen('orders')` to `goTo('orders')` so the orders list reloads when navigating back from order detail.
- **Files changed:** `admin-dashboard/index.html`, `customer-app/index.html`
- **Next session priorities:**
  1. Test full order lifecycle end-to-end as driver (pickup → delivery)
  2. Dedicated Retail POS screen (future — iPad at counter, Retail pricing by transaction not customer)

### Mar 18, 2026 (session 35) — Route driver propagation fix, RCC cleanup

- **Bug fix — driver schedule changes not propagating to future routes (commit `49e8f6e`):**
  - **Problem:** `assignDriverOverride()` only updated `routes.driver_id` for today's route records. Any route records that already existed for future dates kept their null `driver_id`, causing the Order Schedule to show "Unassigned" even when the Drivers > Schedule grid showed a driver assigned. Berkeley AM and PM for Mar 19 were affected — Oakland routes happened to work because they were created after the schedule was set.
  - **Root cause:** The propagation block checked `if (Number(day) === todayDow)` — restricting updates to today only.
  - **Fix:** Now queries all existing routes for the template from today onward, filters by matching day-of-week, and updates `driver_id` on all of them. Today's routes also get their pending/en_route stops reassigned (same as before). Future routes just get the route-level `driver_id` updated.
  - **Belt-and-suspenders — RCC schedule fallback:** When `rccToggleRoute` opens a column and finds `route.driver_id` is null, it now checks `route_driver_schedule` for the matching template + day-of-week. If found, it displays the correct driver name AND backfills the route record (fire-and-forget DB update). This catches any routes that were created before the fix.
  - **Data loaded in `loadDailyRuns`:** Added `route_driver_schedule` to the parallel fetch so the fallback lookup is instant.
  - **Backfilled:** Berkeley AM + PM for Mar 19, Berkeley AM + PM for Mar 20 — all now have correct `driver_id`.
  - **Design principle reinforced:** "The Drivers Schedule and Order Schedule must always agree. A change in one must propagate to the other."
- **RCC — exclude failed/on-hold orders from chip counts (commit `945517c`, carried from session 34):**
  - `_dsCountMap` builder now uses the same exclusion list as `activeStops`: `pickup_failed`, `delivery_failed`, `on_hold`, `delivered`, `cancelled`, `skipped`. Route chip badges no longer count problem orders.
- **File changed:** `admin-dashboard/index.html` (`assignDriverOverride`, `loadDailyRuns`, `rccToggleRoute`, `_dsCountMap` builder)
- **Bug fix — driver SMS "no phone on file" for upcoming routes (commit `10ca98a`):**
  - `_msgCustomerMap` was only built from `todayRoutes`. Customers on upcoming routes had no entry, causing "No phone number on file" when the driver tried to text them. Fixed by including `upcomingRoutes` in the map builder.
- **Driver SMS thread filtering — session-based clean start (commits `9911495`, `208c245`):**
  - **Problem:** Driver's customer SMS thread showed full message history including admin-sent notifications. Three iterations of filtering: (1) today-only → still showed admin texts, (2) driver-sent + inbound only → still showed old customer replies, (3) session-based `_smsSessionStart` timestamp.
  - **Final fix:** `_smsSessionStart` is set when driver data loads. Only messages created after this timestamp appear in the conversation list and thread view. Clean slate every time the driver opens the app.
- **Driver app — Call Customer + Send Text CTA buttons (commit `07ae964`):**
  - Two prominent action buttons added to stop detail view: "Call Customer" (tel: link) and "Send Text" (opens SMS thread). Uses space previously wasted.
- **Driver app — stop detail card redesign (commits `120755e`, `61485d6`):**
  - Removed phone number display (redundant with Call button). Elevated delivery instructions into a yellow callout card. Card-based layout for address, instructions, bags/preferences. Action buttons pushed to bottom of scroll area using flexbox `margin-top: auto`.
- **Bug fix — address resolution showing wrong address on map + schedule (commit `f390c62`):**
  - **Problem:** Both RCC and driver app fetched addresses via `.eq('is_default', true)` on the customer, ignoring the actual `address_id` on route_stops and order `pickup_address_id`/`delivery_address_id`. Orders placed at non-default addresses (Berkeley) showed the customer's default address (Oakland) on the map and in cards.
  - **Fix:** Three locations updated (admin `rccToggleRoute`, `rccRefreshRoute`, driver `loadDriverData`). Now fetches addresses by ID first from the stop/order, falls back to customer default only if no specific address is set.
- **Bug fix — admin order creation missing service, bags, pricing (commit `6ee028b`):**
  - **Problem:** Admin dashboard's `saveOrder()` didn't set `service_id`, `total_bags`, or `total_amount`. Orders created from admin showed "—" for service name and "$0.00" in the customer app.
  - **Fix:** Added Bags input + Service dropdown to the New Order modal. `saveOrder()` now includes `service_id`, `total_bags`, `total_amount`, and `line_items`. Service dropdown defaults to Wash & Fold ($59/bag). Also patched order #138 in DB directly.
- **Migration — `customer_type` default changed to 'Delivery' (migration `default_customer_type_to_delivery`):**
  - DB default was `'individual'`, now `'Delivery'`. All 13 existing customers with `'individual'` backfilled to `'Delivery'`. Processing code already normalized this, but data is now clean.
  - **Design note:** The Price List field (customer_type) determines which service prices apply at processing intake. All customers default to Delivery pricing. Commercial customers get Commercial pricing. Retail (walk-in POS) is a future build — pricing should be tied to the transaction channel, not the customer profile.
- **Files changed:** `admin-dashboard/index.html` (New Order modal, `saveOrder`, `populateOrderModal`, `rccToggleRoute`, `rccRefreshRoute`), `driver-app/index.html` (SMS filtering, stop detail redesign, address resolution, CTA buttons)
- **Next session priorities:**
  1. Test full order lifecycle end-to-end as driver (pickup → delivery)
  2. Test unified messaging with live orders
  3. Dedicated Retail POS screen (future — iPad at counter, Retail pricing by transaction not customer)
  4. Route picker fine-tuning (backlog)

### Mar 18, 2026 (session 34) — Driver assignment fix, driver app polish, sequential stop numbers, auto-fail buffer fix, unified messaging

**Late-session additions (unified messaging + map pins):**

- **Driver app — unified messaging system (Team + Customer threads):**
  - **Messages tab rewritten** from a flat admin-only chat into a conversation list. Two sections: "Team" (admin ↔ driver via `driver_messages`) and "Customers" (driver ↔ customer via Twilio SMS).
  - **Customer threads**: driver types a message → sent via `send-sms` edge function → Twilio delivers from Family Laundry's number (+15105884102). Customer replies arrive via Twilio webhook → stored in `sms_messages` → surfaced to driver via realtime. Customer never sees the driver's personal phone number.
  - **"Text" button** on stop detail now opens the customer's conversation thread instead of the native SMS app.
  - **Realtime**: subscribed to both `driver_messages` INSERT and `sms_messages` INSERT. Unread badges on both conversation list and nav tab.
  - **RLS policy** `driver_read_customer_sms`: drivers can only read SMS for customers on their today's routes. Uses `current_driver_id()` helper.
  - **DB migration** `sms_messages_driver_access`: added `sent_by_driver_id UUID` (FK → drivers, ON DELETE SET NULL) + RLS policy.
  - **Edge function** `send-sms` v16: now accepts and stores `sent_by_driver_id`.
  - **Design principle**: "Drivers never text from their personal phone. All customer communication flows through the business number."
- **Admin RCC — map pins use sequential stop numbers:** Pin labels now read `_displayNum` (1, 2, 3...) instead of raw DB `stop_number`. Consistent with the card numbers in the column view.
- **Driver app — stop detail header** shows sequential number ("STOP 1") instead of DB stop_number ("STOP 5").

---

**Earlier in session 34:**

- **Repo migration:** Project moved from Cowork sandbox to `~/Projects/WashRoute`. Standard git commands work normally. WashRoute skill updated to reflect new path.
- **Bug fix — driver assignment not saving for completed routes (commit `f21cb9c`):**
  - **Problem:** In the Drivers > Schedule grid, clicking a driver on a route where all stops were done (but window still open) would update `route_driver_schedule` but NOT the live `routes.driver_id`. The chip reads from `routes.driver_id` for today, so it kept showing the old driver even though the underlying save ran.
  - **Fix:** The early-return path in `assignDriverOverride()` now also updates `routes.driver_id` before re-rendering.
- **Bug fix — new routes created without driver_id:**
  - **Problem:** `opCreateRouteAndSelect()` was inserting route records with `driver_id = null` because it didn't consult `route_driver_schedule`.
  - **Fix:** Added `_opDriverSched` cache (populated in `opPrefetchRoutes`). New routes now get the correct driver for the template + day_of_week on insert.
- **Bug fix — past weeks reflecting current schedule changes:**
  - **Problem:** For past days where no route record existed in the DB, the chip fell back to `route_driver_schedule` (current schedule). Changing today's driver to Marcus made all past Wednesdays without records also show Marcus.
  - **Fix:** Past days with no route record now show null/Unassigned instead of the current schedule. Only actual route records are shown as historical truth.
- **File changed:** `admin-dashboard/index.html` (both `renderWeeklySchedule` and `renderDriverSchedule` makeChip functions + `assignDriverOverride` + `opCreateRouteAndSelect` + `opPrefetchRoutes`)
- **Driver app — hide skipped/failed stops (commit `88ad89d`):**
  - Skipped and failed stops are now filtered out of the driver's route view entirely. Driver only sees `pending`, `en_route`, and `complete` stops. Applied to main route stops, override (reassigned) stops, and upcoming stops.
  - Progress counts ("Done" / "Left") now count only `complete` — skipped no longer inflates progress.
  - **Design principle:** "The driver should only see what is relevant to them at that given time. Any non-actionable item is unnecessary clutter."
  - **File changed:** `driver-app/index.html` (3 filter locations + 4 done-count locations)
- **Driver app — realtime refresh on route reassignment (commit `6de9a60`):**
  - **Problem:** When admin reassigned a route to a different driver, the original driver's app didn't update until manual refresh.
  - **Root cause 1:** The `route_stops` UPDATE handler required `isMyRoute()` to be true before reloading — but when a whole route was reassigned, it wasn't in the driver's `todayRoutes` yet. Fixed by reloading whenever `driver_id` matches the current driver, regardless of route ownership.
  - **Root cause 2:** The `routes` table was NOT in the `supabase_realtime` publication. Added a `routes` UPDATE listener to detect route-level driver changes, but events were never broadcast. Fixed with `ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE routes`.
  - **File changed:** `driver-app/index.html` (realtime subscription in `subscribeToRouteStopUpdates`)
  - **DB change:** `routes` added to `supabase_realtime` publication
- **Driver app — time window on stop cards (commit `4b76d89`):**
  - Stop cards now show the pickup or delivery time window (e.g. "7–9 AM") in the metadata line, using the `stopWindow()` helper + `fmtSlot()`.
  - Completed stops also show the completion time.
- **Sequential stop numbers — both admin RCC and driver app (commit `e0c5ed6`):**
  - **Problem:** After skipping/filtering stops, the DB `stop_number` (e.g. #5) was displayed even when it was the only visible stop. Confusing for drivers.
  - **Fix:** Both the admin RCC and driver app now assign `_displayNum` sequentially (1, 2, 3...) after filtering/sorting. The DB `stop_number` is still used for ordering — only the display number changes. Applied to all 4 rendering paths in the driver app and the RCC column renderer.
  - **Design principle:** "Admin RCC and driver app are two views of the same truth — stop numbers must always match."
- **DB migration — `auto_fail_expired_orders()` buffer fix (migrations `auto_fail_use_route_window_end` + `auto_fail_fix_timezone_in_route_window`):**
  - **Problem:** The pg_cron auto-fail function used `order.pickup_window_end + 2 hours` as the cutoff. But the order's window is the **customer-facing slot** (e.g. 7–9 AM), which is narrower than the route's operational window (7–11 AM). Order #131 on Oakland AM (slot 7–9 AM) was auto-failed at 11 AM while the driver was still on the route.
  - **Fix:** Function now joins through `route_stops → routes → route_templates` to get the route's `window_end`, uses `GREATEST(order slot end, route window end) + 2 hours`. Route template times correctly converted with `AT TIME ZONE 'America/Los_Angeles'` (DB runs in UTC, route times are stored as plain TIME in Pacific).
  - **Result:** Oakland AM orders now auto-fail at 1 PM Pacific (route end 11 AM + 2hr buffer) instead of 11 AM. Driver app visibility already used `window_end + 2hr` — now the cron job matches.
  - **Order #131 rescued:** Reset from `pickup_failed` back to `scheduled` / `pending`.
  - **Delivery failures:** Same GREATEST logic applied to the delivery failure loop.
- **Commits:** `f21cb9c`, `4edb133`, `88ad89d`, `6de9a60`, `4b76d89`, `15bca45`, `e0c5ed6`, `8918bfe` (docs), `c0b9e7d` (docs)
- **Next session priorities:**
  1. Test full order lifecycle end-to-end as driver (pickup → delivery)
  2. Test CloudPRNT with physical printer
  3. Route picker fine-tuning (backlog)

### Mar 18, 2026 (session 33) — Schedule lock fix: routes stay open until window_end + 2hr buffer

- **Problem:** The Drivers > Schedule view locked today's route chips (showing 🔒 and disabling driver reassignment) as soon as all current stops were in a terminal state (completed/skipped/failed). This prevented assigning drivers to routes where all existing stops were skipped but new orders could still be added throughout the day. Example: Berkeley PM (6–10pm) showed locked at 7am because its 2 skipped stops = "all done."
- **Root cause:** Lock logic was `isLocked = isPast || isComplete` — it didn't consider whether the route's time window had actually passed.
- **Fix:** Changed to `isLocked = isPast || (isToday && isComplete && windowClosed)` where `windowClosed` = current time ≥ `window_end + 2 hours`. Applied to all 3 places: pickup schedule `makeChip`, delivery schedule `makeChip`, and the driver reassignment popover.
- **UX changes:**
  - Today's routes with all stops done but window still open: show ✓ checkmark (not 🔒), remain clickable for driver reassignment
  - Popover shows blue info banner: "All N current stops done — route window still open, new orders can still be added"
  - Routes only truly lock after window_end + 2hr buffer passes AND all stops are done
- **Design principle added:** "Routes stay open until window_end + 2hr buffer" — orders can arrive throughout the day, so schedule flexibility must be preserved.
- **File changed:** `admin-dashboard/index.html` (3 locations)

### Mar 19, 2026 (session 36) — Claude AI SMS replies + PICKUP evening default

- **`twilio-webhook` upgraded to v22 (from v18):** Full inbound SMS intelligence overhaul.
  - **PICKUP keyword** — now defaults to **evening route** (`window_start.desc`). Previously defaulted to earliest/AM route (`window_start.asc`). Books next available evening pickup using last order as template; falls back to default address + `get_zones_for_point` RPC for new customers. Blocks if active order already exists.
  - **Claude AI handler** — all messages that aren't SKIP/PICKUP/HELP now go to `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` with the customer's name + active order context (status label, pickup window, delivery window). Claude answers status/ETA questions naturally, guides customers to PICKUP/SKIP keywords, and escalates complaints/billing issues to the human inbox by returning `ESCALATE`. Falls back gracefully to human inbox if API key missing or Claude errors.
  - **QA fixes applied:** Added `out_for_delivery` to `statusLabels` (Claude gets a human-readable label instead of raw snake_case); added null guard on `newOrder` destructure after order creation.
  - **SKIP and HELP** — unchanged from v18.
- **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` added to Supabase Secrets** — required for Claude AI handler. Without it, all non-keyword messages route silently to human inbox.
- **Twilio A2P 10DLC confirmed fully live** — David confirmed messaging works end-to-end. Removed from pending list.
- **Xero and Klaviyo removed from backlog** — deprioritised by David.
- **Next session priorities:**
  1. SMS Phase 2 — natural-language cancellations ("cancel Thursday") — needs `conversations` table
  2. Route picker fine-tuning (backlog)

---

### Mar 24, 2026 (session 61) — Stat card revamp, billing pipeline fix, Request Card actions, customer support

**Stat card revamp (admin-dashboard/index.html):**
- Expanded from 4 to 6 stat cards in a responsive CSS grid: Picked Up Today, Delivered Today, Orders Processing, Ready for Delivery, $ In Process (new), Revenue Today (fixed)
- **Timezone fix:** All stat card date comparisons now use `toLocalDate()` with `BIZ_TZ` (Pacific time) instead of raw UTC string comparison. `today()` helper returns Pacific-time YYYY-MM-DD. Was causing wrong counts after 5 PM Pacific.
- **$ In Process card:** Shows total_amount of orders in picked_up/processing/folding that haven't been charged yet
- **Revenue Today accuracy fix:** Changed from counting all delivered orders to only counting orders where `billing_status='paid'` and `billed_at` is today (Pacific time)
- Added responsive breakpoints: 3 columns at ≤1100px, 2 columns at ≤600px

**Billing pipeline fix (charge-order v25 + stripe-webhook v24):**
- **Root cause:** `charge-order` edge function was successfully charging via Stripe but never writing `billing_status` or `billed_at` back to the orders table. Revenue Today showed $388 instead of the actual $4,200+ collected.
- **charge-order v25 deployed:** Now sets `billing_status='paid'` + `billed_at` on successful charge, `billing_status='failed'` on decline
- **stripe-webhook v24 deployed:** Added `payment_intent.succeeded` and `payment_intent.payment_failed` handlers as backup safety net — catches cases where the edge function response is lost but Stripe actually processed the payment
- **Backfill:** 74 previously-charged orders (with `stripe_payment_intent_id` but null `billing_status`) updated to `billing_status='paid'` with `billed_at` set from `updated_at`
- **QA fix (this session):** Removed stale line in `retryChargeFromIssues()` that was overwriting `billing_status` back to null after a successful retry charge — conflicted with v25 which now sets it to 'paid'

**Request Card / Retry / Update Card action column (admin-dashboard/index.html):**
- Added "Request card" button to Issues, Delivered, In Process, and Ready tabs for orders where the customer has no card on file
- **3-way billing action logic (session 70h):** (1) No card on file → "Request card" button. (2) Card on file + never tried or new card added after last failure → "Retry charge" button. (3) Card on file but same card already declined (`charge_failed_at` newer than `customer_payment_methods.created_at`) → "📞 Update card" button (calls `promptUpdateCard()` with customer name/phone).
- Tracks which customers already received a card request SMS (queries `sms_messages` for body containing "card on file") — shows greyed-out "✓ Requested" badge instead of duplicate button
- `_custCardAddedAt` Map tracks latest card `created_at` per customer; refreshed on `loadOrders()` and via realtime INSERT listener on `customer_payment_methods`
- `_cardRequestSent` Set refreshed on every `loadOrders()` call
- `_deliveredActionBtn()` function handles all non-Issues tabs; `issueActionBtn()` handles Issues tab
- `retryChargeFromIssues()` catch block now calls `loadOrders()` on failure so UI picks up new `charge_failed_at` and switches to "Update card" automatically

**Additional timezone fix:**
- Fixed `loadRouteAssignments()` (customer panel) — was using `new Date().toISOString().slice(0,10)` for "today" comparison against route dates. Changed to use `today()` helper with BIZ_TZ.

**Customer support:**
- **Melissa Crouch:** Deleted duplicate customer record (0 orders) + orphaned auth.users entry + orphaned profile. Working account uses phone auth (978-270-4555).
- **Marcie Gutierrez:** "Token has expired or is invalid" error on login — OTP code expiring before entry. Suggested entering code faster; consider increasing OTP expiry in Supabase auth settings.
- **Danai Lamb:** Phone formatting issue investigated — David corrected in admin.

**Realtime card-added listener (admin-dashboard/index.html):**
- Subscribes to INSERT on `customer_payment_methods` via Supabase realtime
- When a customer adds a card: adds to `_custWithCard`, removes from `_cardRequestSent`, shows toast with customer name, re-renders orders table so badges update instantly
- Enabled realtime publication for `customer_payment_methods` table in Supabase
- Card request SMS conversion: 29 customers added a card within 4 hours of receiving the request

**Customer app bug fix (customer-app/index.html):**
- **`handleNameSubmit()` null crash:** `loadUserData()` used global `currentUser` which could be null if auth state change listener hadn't fired yet (race condition). Now sets `currentUser` from local `user` variable before calling `loadUserData()`. Added guard in `loadUserData()` itself. Shows "Session expired" message if `getUser()` returns null.
- Triggered by Danai Lamb seeing "null is not an object (evaluating 'currentUser.id')" on the signup form

**Customer support (continued):**
- **Laura Woltag:** Had 2 accounts (Starchup migration + new signup). Merged: moved phone, $20 credit, transaction/SMS history, and combined lifetime value ($708.70) to the active account. Deleted old customer + profile + auth user. David issuing $20 refund on order #659 separately.
- **Alena Hutchinson:** "Token invalid" on OTP — same as Marcie Gutierrez. She eventually got in (auth shows last_sign_in today). OTP expiry too short for some users.
- **Cynthia Williams:** Not receiving OTP SMS at all. Email is `jazzblack@att.net` — likely AT&T landline, which can't receive SMS. Has no auth user (never successfully logged in). Waiting for her response to confirm.

**Commits:**
- `921807b` — Revenue Today: only count orders with billing_status=paid
- `a5afc7c` — Fix stat card timezone bug: convert UTC timestamps to Pacific time
- `16c6d57` — Add Request Card action to Delivered tab, show sent status on both tabs
- `da0a46f` — Add Request Card action column to In Process and Ready tabs
- `709d504` — Add $ In Process stat card showing potential billings for orders not yet charged
- `ae64d24` — QA fixes: billing_status overwrite, route assignments timezone, responsive grid
- `b56c746` — Realtime card-added listener: badges update instantly
- `fedc338` — Fix null currentUser crash on customer app signup form

**QA findings (this session):**
- HIGH: `retryChargeFromIssues()` was overwriting `billing_status` to null after successful charge — FIXED
- LOW: `loadRouteAssignments()` timezone bug — FIXED
- LOW: 6-column grid had no responsive breakpoints — FIXED (added media queries)
- LOW: onclick handlers interpolate `custId`/`phone` values directly into HTML strings — XSS risk is minimal (admin-only app, data from Supabase) but noted for future refactor
- LOW: `handleNameSubmit()` race condition with null `currentUser` — FIXED
- ~~The `toISOString().slice(0,10)` usages in the scheduling/reschedule UI were considered safe~~ — **WRONG. Fixed session 62.** These DID cause PM routes (6 PM Pacific = 1 AM UTC next day) to match wrong-date routes. All replaced with `toLocalDate()` (Pacific time)

**Security review (session 61):**
- No secret keys (sk_live, Twilio auth tokens, service role keys) exposed in client code — PASS
- Stripe publishable key (pk_live) in admin dashboard is expected and safe
- **XSS via onclick handlers (MEDIUM):** `custId`, `phone`, `email` interpolated directly into onclick strings across admin dashboard. Risk is low (admin-only app, data from Supabase, not user-editable in freeform) but should be refactored to use data attributes + delegated listeners
- **XSS via data attributes (MEDIUM):** Customer names/phones in `data-*` attributes on order table rows not HTML-escaped. Same low-risk profile as above.
- **localStorage PII (MEDIUM):** Customer app caches card_last4, card_brand in localStorage for performance. No full card numbers. Consider clearing on logout.
- **Edge functions with verify_jwt:false (MEDIUM):** `charge-order`, `send-sms`, `cloudprnt` have JWT verification off — they validate via apikey header instead. Acceptable for current scale but should add request-origin validation if public traffic grows.
- **innerHTML with error messages (LOW):** A few `innerHTML` calls include `error.message` from Supabase — could reflect unexpected content. Should use `textContent` for error display.
- **No CSRF tokens (LOW):** Edge function calls use standard fetch with no CSRF protection. Mitigated by Supabase apikey requirement and CORS.
- **Overall assessment:** No critical vulnerabilities found. Admin-only XSS vectors are the highest priority for future hardening. No credential leaks. Payment processing is server-side only (Stripe secret key in Supabase secrets, never in client code).

**Pending (carries forward):**
1. Re-enable `review_request` and `reorder_reminder` SMS templates when ready
2. Resolve 5 unpaid delivered orders ($567.75) — confirm if paid on Starchup side
3. Consider increasing Supabase OTP expiry for customers with slow entry (Marcie Gutierrez, Alena Hutchinson)
4. Cynthia Williams — likely landline, can't receive OTP. May need email login fallback in customer app
5. Credits not applied at charge time — only at Intake. If credit is added after Intake, it's missed. Consider adding credit check to `charge-order` edge function
6. Future refactor: replace inline onclick string interpolation with data attributes + delegated event listeners
7. Security hardening: escape customer data in data attributes/onclick handlers, clear localStorage on logout

### Mar 24, 2026 (session 63) — Route map UX cleanup, data corrections, real-time dispatch planning

**Route map & list UX overhaul (admin-dashboard/index.html):**
- **Hide completed stops:** Stops with status `complete`, `skipped`, or `failed` are now hidden from both the stop card list AND the map pins. Only remaining (pending/en_route) stops are visible — giving drivers and admins a clear picture of what's left.
- **Remove route lines:** Removed all polyline drawing from the map (pickup lines and delivery dashed lines). The map was becoming an unreadable maze of overlapping colored lines. Now it's clean pins only, color-coded by route.
- **Updated chip badge counts:** The colored route pills at the top now show remaining stop count (not total), so you can see at a glance how many stops are left per route.
- **Header stats updated:** Column headers show remaining P/D counts + "X done" indicator with progress bar for overall completion tracking.

**Data corrections (4 stops fixed on Oakland AM Mar 25):**
- Jeremy Dunn — delivery stop skipped (order was `cancelled` but stop was still `pending`)
- Stacy Kawula — delivery stop skipped (order was `skipped` but stop was still `pending`)
- David Macquart-Moulin — stale `complete` pickup from Mar 15 skipped (orphaned on wrong route)
- Constance Moore — delivery moved from Oakland AM to Oakland PM (her window is 8-10 PM, not AM)
- Oakland AM went from 42 → 38 stops after cleanup.

**Real-time dispatch optimizer — Phase 1 planned:**
- Reviewed current `optimize-route` edge function (v13): uses Google Directions API with `optimize:true` waypoints, geographic-extremes N/S endpoint selection, separate pickup/delivery optimization.
- Identified 7 gaps vs production dispatch needs: no time-window awareness, no ETAs, no at-risk flagging, no periodic re-optimization, no driver app auto-refresh, no service time accounting, uses legacy Directions API instead of Routes API.
- 4-phase improvement plan approved: (1) time-window-aware optimization + ETAs, (2) real-time driver app updates, (3) periodic re-optimization via pg_cron, (4) admin dashboard ETA display + at-risk badges.

**Files changed:** `admin-dashboard/index.html`

### Mar 29, 2026 (session 79b) — Edge case audit: address sync trigger + reschedule notifications

**Proactive audit of high-frequency edge cases (8 checks run):**

6 of 8 checks passed clean. Two structural gaps found and fixed:

**Fix 1 — Address change not propagating to route stop (Finding 2, latent bug):**
- Trigger `trg_sync_stop_address_on_order_address_change` added to `orders` table.
- Fires AFTER UPDATE on `pickup_address_id` or `delivery_address_id` changes.
- Updates the corresponding pending route stop's `address_id` to match.
- Previously, changing an order's address without changing the time window left the driver navigating to the old address. Zero current instances but structurally inevitable.
- Migration SQL: `database/sync_stop_address_on_order_address_change.sql`

**Fix 2 — No customer notification when pickup/delivery is rescheduled (Finding 1, structural gap):**
- Two new SMS templates added to `message_templates`: `schedule_changed` (pickup rescheduled) and `delivery_rescheduled` (delivery rescheduled).
- `send-order-notification` v25: added `schedule_changed` and `delivery_rescheduled` to EVENT_TO_TRIGGER; `delivery_rescheduled` correctly shows delivery window.
- Admin dashboard: fires `schedule_changed` or `delivery_rescheduled` after saving a reschedule when a new time slot is chosen (not just route reassignment).
- Customer app `saveEditOrder()`: fires appropriate event after successful schedule save.
- Both fire best-effort (non-blocking), so a Twilio hiccup never breaks the save flow.

**Audit checks that were clean:** recurring order address inheritance ✅, same-day window overlap ✅, routing_error orphans ✅, stop/order status desync ✅, run_id route date mismatch ✅, split-address order routing ✅, no SMS double-fire on reschedule ✅

**Files changed:** `database/sync_stop_address_on_order_address_change.sql` (new), `admin-dashboard/index.html`, `customer-app/index.html`, edge function `send-order-notification` v24→v25 (deployed)

**Pending (carries forward):**
1. Receipt template — iPad POS cache clear needed
2. Small "v" character at top of receipt
3. Patricia Carroll — no email, needs manual phone call for $68.95 (order #770)
4. Unpaid orders — customers without cards (~42 orders, ~$4,494.90)

### Mar 29, 2026 (session 79) — SMS confirmation wrong address bug fixed

**Root cause:** `send-order-notification` edge function was using `customer.address_cache` (the customer's default/saved address) as the PRIMARY address source, only falling back to the order's `pickup_address_id` if `address_cache` was empty. Customers who selected a different address at booking received confirmation SMSs showing their old default address instead.

**Discovery:** Selena Bowie (#1148) texted "No this is not the address that I put" — SMS showed "1175 12th Street" (her default) but she booked "71 10th Street" for this order. DB query confirmed 37 orders in the past 30 days had the same mismatch (pickup_address_id resolves to a different street than address_cache).

**Fix (send-order-notification v24, 2026-03-29):**
- Address resolution now reads from `order.pickup_address_id` (then `delivery_address_id`) FIRST.
- Only falls back to `address_cache` if the order has no address ID or the lookup returns empty.
- Added detailed console logging: `Address from order: addrId=... resolved="..."` and `Address fallback to address_cache: "..."` so future debugging is easy.
- Bug comment in code explains root cause, scope (37 orders / 30 days), and discovery context.

**Preflight check:** LOW risk — code-only deployment, no DB writes, no triggers, no fan-out.

**Full address audit across all SMS-sending paths:**
- `send-order-notification` v24 — FIXED ✅ (root cause, 37 orders/30 days actively affected)
- `send-scheduled-reminders` v16 — FIXED ✅ (same `address_cache` bug in `runDayBefore` + `runDayOf`; current templates don't use `{{address}}` so no active impact, but it was a time bomb)
- `notify-on-my-way` — ✅ CLEAN (no address variable in message body)
- `send-receipt` — ✅ CLEAN (already correctly JOINs `pickup_address_id` from addresses table)
- Admin dashboard — ✅ CLEAN (`address_cache` only used for CloudPRNT intake label, not outbound SMS)
- Customer app — ✅ CLEAN (correctly writes `pickup_address_id` at booking; reads back via JOIN)
- Driver app — ✅ CLEAN (uses `address_id`/`pickup_address_id` for stop display)

**⚠️ Correct pattern going forward:** Always JOIN `pickup_address:pickup_address_id(line1,line2,city,state,zip)` from the `addresses` table when building customer-facing messages. Use `address_cache` ONLY as a last-resort fallback when the order has no `pickup_address_id`.

### Mar 29, 2026 (session 78) — Wrong-date stop root fix: pickup sync trigger + routing_error flag

**P0 investigation: Heather Gould #808 stops on Apr 7 routes despite Mar 30/31 pickup/delivery windows**
- Root cause confirmed via order_events: order was originally created Mar 24 for Apr 7 (correctly routed). Rescheduled TWICE today in 24-second succession by recurring order system: Apr 7 → Apr 6 → Mar 30. Stops never moved.
- Two structural gaps identified:
  1. `trg_sync_delivery_stop_on_window_change` only handles delivery stops — pickup stops have no equivalent trigger and are always left stranded when rescheduled.
  2. Both triggers fail silently when target route is at capacity — stop stays on wrong-date route with no error flag, audit Check 2 catches it after the fact.
- **Immediate fix:** Both stops manually moved to correct routes — pickup to Mar 30 Oakland AM (#36), delivery to Mar 31 Oakland PM (#34). `pickup_run_id` and `delivery_run_id` on order updated. `moved_from_route_id` set. ✅

**DB migration applied: `add_pickup_stop_sync_trigger_and_routing_error_flag`**
- Created `sync_pickup_stop_on_window_change()` function — exact mirror of delivery trigger logic, fires on `pickup_window_start` changes, auto-routes pickup stop to correct date/template.
- Created `trg_sync_pickup_stop_on_window_change` — BEFORE UPDATE on orders WHEN pickup_window_start changes.
- Updated `sync_delivery_stop_on_window_change()` — added `v_moved` flag; if loop exhausts without finding eligible route, sets `routing_error = 'rescheduled_no_capacity'`. Morning audit Check 1 catches these immediately.
- Migration SQL saved to `database/add_pickup_stop_sync_trigger_and_routing_error_flag.sql`.

**DB migration applied: `fix_reset_failed_delivery_stop_scope_to_active_route`**
- `reset_failed_delivery_stop()` was resetting ALL failed delivery/pickup stops when run_id changed — including old historical stops on past routes. Discovered when rescheduling Level Up Wellness #522: the Mar 25 failed stop was revived to 'pending' alongside the new Mar 30 stop.
- Fix: added `AND route_id = NEW.delivery_run_id` / `AND route_id = NEW.pickup_run_id` to both WHERE clauses. Old stops on past routes stay failed permanently.
- Migration SQL saved to `database/fix_reset_failed_delivery_stop_scope_to_active_route.sql`.

**Level Up Wellness #522 — fully resolved**
- History: 7 Stripe charge attempts (1 Failed, 6 Blocked by Stripe Radar, 1 Succeeded). Blocking happened before Stripe anti-fraud rules were relaxed. Multiple retries were from WashRoute's own retry logic — no rate limiting/backoff. Charge confirmed Succeeded $186.95 Mar 28 11:43 AM.
- `billing_status` manually corrected to `paid`. ✅
- New delivery stop created: Mar 30 Oakland AM, stop #37, 9–11 AM window. Order status → `ready_for_delivery`. ✅

### Mar 28, 2026 (session 77) — Morning audit: billing_status backfill + audit skill hardening

**Morning audit findings:**
- ✅ No unrouted orders, wrong-date stops, status desync, duplicate orders
- ⚠️ Oakland routes over capacity all week (6 routes, peak 26/20 stops) — needs capacity review
- 📋 11 driverless routes next 7 days (Alameda, Berkeley, Concord routes — expected low-volume)
- 📋 3 SMS opt-out sync gaps, 18 duplicate addresses, 187 orphan profiles

**Investigation: 13 delivered orders with Stripe payment intent but `billing_status = null`**
- Root cause split in two groups:
  1. Orders charged Mar 24–27: predated `charge-order` v26 (session 70h) which first introduced the `billing_status` write. Older versions only stamped `billed_at`.
  2. Orders charged Mar 28 (including post-v28 Elizabeth Clements, Ariel Ward, Sameer Jain etc.): `charge-order` does two separate DB writes — stamps `billed_at` immediately, then writes `billing_status='paid'` after Stripe confirms. If step 2 silently fails (timeout/edge function error), orders land with `billed_at` set but `billing_status` null.
- Verified all 13 in Stripe live mode — all show "Succeeded". Money was collected.
- Bulk corrected: `UPDATE orders SET billing_status = 'paid' WHERE stripe_payment_intent_id IN (...)` — 13 orders, ~$1,388 total.

**Tech debt logged:** `charge-order` needs its two DB writes consolidated into a single atomic UPDATE to eliminate the partial-state window. Next time the function is touched, fix this.

**Morning audit skill (washroute-audit) updated:**
- Added **Check 3b** — "Charged but billing_status missing": catches `billed_at IS NOT NULL AND charge_failed_at IS NULL AND billing_status NOT IN ('paid','refunded')`. Would have surfaced these 13 orders in seconds.
- Fixed **Check 10** bug: duplicate-addresses SQL used `address_line1` (wrong column name, errors on run). Corrected to `line1`.
- Updated file saved to `washroute/washroute-audit-SKILL-updated.md` — David to copy to `.claude/skills/washroute-audit/SKILL.md`.

### Mar 28, 2026 (session 74) — Stripe webhook fix, Radar CVC rule, customer/address dedup

**Stripe — Root cause of cards not saving / charges failing (TWO issues found and fixed):**

1. **Duplicate webhook endpoint:** Stripe Dashboard had TWO webhook endpoints ("brilliant-oasis" at 0% errors, "Delivery App" at 100% errors) both pointing to `stripe-webhook`. Every event fired twice — one succeeded, one failed with 400 signature mismatch. Deleted the stale "Delivery App" endpoint. Cards now save reliably through the single working endpoint.

2. **Stripe Radar CVC block rule:** Even after cards saved correctly, charges were being BLOCKED (not declined) by Stripe Radar's "Block if CVC check fails" rule. The card issuers approved the charges, but Radar killed them. Disabled the CVC block rule. This was the root cause of the recurring "CVC mismatch" pattern David reported across multiple customers.

**charge-order v28 deployed — status guard:**
- Added `CHARGEABLE_STATUSES = ['ready_for_delivery', 'out_for_delivery', 'delivered']` guard. Orders not yet at these statuses cannot be charged. Prevents premature charging of `scheduled`/`picked_up` orders.
- Fixed order #798 (Rachel Lederman) which was incorrectly showing as declined — it was still `scheduled` and should never have been charged.
- Issues tab filter updated to only show `billing_status='failed'` for chargeable-status orders.

**Admin Dashboard — Payment indicator on Customer List:**
- Added "Pay" column to Customer List showing card status: green card icon (card on file), blue building icon (on account), amber warning icon (no card). Uses `_custPayIcon()` function backed by `_custWithCard` Set.
- Real-time update: when a customer adds a card (via Stripe webhook → `customer_payment_methods` insert), the customer list re-renders to show the updated icon.

**Card cleanup:**
- Deleted 4 bad cards that were saved during the dual-webhook period: Front Administrator (Visa ···8213), Level Up Wellness (Visa ···0608), Jon Relyea (Visa ···2915), Elizabeth Clements (Mastercard ···4097).
- Elizabeth Clements re-added her card and charged successfully ($57.95 order #357) — confirmed both fixes work end-to-end.

**Customer merges (session 74):**
- **Thomas Cannon** — empty duplicate (0 orders, created today from card setup) merged into real account (74 orders, $6,451.40). Card (Mastercard ···5820) moved to keeper.
- **Virginia Kiley** — empty duplicate merged into real account (10 orders, $751.55). Card (Visa ···1201) moved to keeper.

**Address dedup:**
- Audited all customers for duplicate addresses on the same `line1`.
- Deleted 58 duplicate addresses that had zero orders referencing them (safe deletes, no FK issues).
- Remaining duplicates where both have orders (e.g. Dallas Butler) left for manual review — need to reassign orders before deleting.

**Edge functions deployed:** `charge-order` v28

**Files changed:** `admin-dashboard/index.html`

**⚠️ STRIPE CONFIG CHANGES (external, not in code):**
- Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks: "Delivery App" endpoint DELETED. Only "brilliant-oasis" remains.
- Stripe Dashboard → Radar → Rules: CVC block rule DISABLED. Charges with failed CVC checks are now allowed through (card issuer authorization is sufficient).

**Pending (carries forward):**
1. Receipt template — iPad POS cache clear needed
2. Small "v" character at top of receipt
3. Patricia Carroll — no email, needs manual phone call for $68.95 (order #770)
4. Monitor Disk IO budget after session 73 cleanup
5. 33 unpaid orders (~$3,400+) — customers need to add cards before charging
6. Belt-and-suspenders client-side card sync (proposed, not yet built) — fallback for when webhook fails
7. Dallas Butler + other dual-order duplicate addresses — need manual reassignment

### Mar 28, 2026 (session 76) — Map address resolution hardening, route creation race fix, address data backfill

**Investigation: Jenn Holloway not appearing on order map**
- David reported Jenn Holloway's delivery stop wasn't plotting on the route map. Investigation revealed her delivery stop had `address_id = NULL`, her order had `delivery_address_id = NULL`, and her only address wasn't marked `is_default`.
- The map's address fallback chain (stop address → same-leg order address → customer default) failed at every step because: (1) it only tried the same-leg address (delivery), not the other leg (pickup), and (2) the customer fallback required `is_default = true` — but 13 single-address customers had `is_default = false`.

**Scope: 13 stops across 4 customers affected**
- Jenn Holloway (order #359) — delivery stop NULL, order had pickup_address_id but not delivery
- Carol Stevenson (orders #322, #355) — no address record at all, only `address_cache`
- Sankofa United Elementary (orders #527, #766) — no address IDs on orders
- Bentley Upper School (orders #554, #1010) — no address IDs on orders

**Fix 1 — Route creation race condition (commit `7ae47e7`):**
- `opCreateRouteAndSelect()` crashed with "duplicate key value violates unique constraint `routes_template_run_date_udx`" when `auto_route_order()` trigger had already created the route. Now checks for existing route before INSERT.

**Fix 2 — Map address resolution hardened (commit `d4c7973`):**
- Fallback chain now: stop address → same-leg order address → **other-leg order address** → any customer address (preferring default, accepting any).
- Customer fallback no longer requires `is_default = true` — queries all addresses sorted by `is_default DESC`, takes first.
- Pickup stop creation also falls back to `delivery_address_id` when `pickup_address_id` is null.

**Fix 3 — Blast radius: same pattern fixed in 3 more locations (commit pending):**
- Admin dashboard RCC column address resolver (line ~16380)
- Driver app stop address resolver (line ~1912)
- `optimize-route` edge function v19 deployed
- All now use the cross-leg + non-default-ok fallback chain.

**Data fixes applied via SQL:**
- Backfilled `address_id` on 9 route_stops from order addresses
- Backfilled `pickup_address_id`/`delivery_address_id` on 5 orders (Sankofa + Bentley)
- Set `is_default = true` for 13 single-address customers (Jenn, Sankofa, Bentley, + 10 others)
- Created address record for Carol Stevenson: 431 Lincoln Way, Unit A, San Francisco, CA 94122 (with delivery instructions)
- Carol's 4 stops and 2 orders now linked to her new address

### Mar 28, 2026 (session 75) — SMS address fallback, admin order SMS, RCC drag-drop fix, QA hardening

**Erroneous SMS investigation (Baby Lee):**
- Customer Baby Lee received `order_confirmed` SMS at 2:09 PM PT saying "Your pickup at is scheduled for Saturday, Mar 28 between 6 pm – 8 pm" — but her only order (#548) had pickup Mar 25 and was at `ready_for_delivery`.
- **Root cause:** Order numbers #1087–#1090 are missing from the sequence (created ~21:07 UTC, then hard-deleted via admin's Delete Orders). Baby placed an order via the customer app; the `placeOrder()` fire-and-forget SMS was sent instantly; the order was subsequently deleted. SMS cannot be recalled after sending.
- Same pattern found for customer Dallas Butler — also received `order_confirmed` SMS with no matching order (also deleted).
- **Broader finding:** 7 out of 15 `order_confirmed` SMS sent on Mar 28 had blank addresses ("Your pickup at is scheduled for...") because `customer.address_cache` was empty for those customers and the edge function had no fallback. 86 of 5,316 total customers have empty `address_cache`.

**Fix 1 — `send-order-notification` v23 deployed:**
- When `customer.address_cache` is empty, the function now fetches the actual address from the `addresses` table using `order.pickup_address_id` (falls back to `delivery_address_id`).
- Added `fmtAddress()` helper to format address rows as one-liners (line1, line2, city/state, zip).
- Added `pickup_address_id` and `delivery_address_id` to the order fetch query.
- If the address lookup fails, falls back to empty string (same as previous behavior — no regression risk).

**Fix 2 — Admin dashboard `saveOrder()` now sends `order_confirmed` SMS:**
- Previously, admin-created orders only sent confirmation email via `send-email`. Now also fires `send-order-notification` with `event: 'confirmed'` (fire-and-forget, same pattern as customer app).
- Closes the known gap noted in PROJECT-NOTES session 35e: "Admin `saveOrder()` does NOT call `send-order-notification` for the `confirmed` event."

**Fix 3 — RCC drag-and-drop now syncs order run IDs (commit `3a03dc9`):**
- When route stops were moved between routes via drag-and-drop in the Route Command Center, the order's `pickup_run_id`/`delivery_run_id` was NOT updated to match the new route. This caused stops to display as "AM" when they'd been moved to a PM route (and vice versa), because the order still referenced the old route.
- **Fix:** `rccDrop()` now updates `orders.pickup_run_id` or `orders.delivery_run_id` (based on `stop_type`) after moving a stop. Also syncs the local `allOrders` cache.
- **Bulk correction:** 130 stale order run IDs were corrected via SQL to match their current route_stop assignments.

**Fix 4 — QA hardening (commit `76099ea`):**
- Closed last dedup gap: `handleNameSubmit()` in customer app now uses `claim_existing_customer` RPC instead of direct table query (was the 4th and final code path — `ensureProfile`, `loadUserData`, `renderConfirmAuth` were already fixed in session 74).
- Added `console.warn` error logging to all 4 `claim_existing_customer` RPC call sites.
- Blast radius check confirmed: all customer-app queries use RLS-safe `profile_id = auth.uid()` filters. No email/phone direct lookups remain.

**Files changed:** `admin-dashboard/index.html`, `customer-app/index.html`

### Mar 28, 2026 (session 74 cont'd) — Duplicate account RPC fix, same-day delivery, credit audit

**Root cause of duplicate customer accounts found and fixed:**
- When returning customers signed up again (new Supabase auth UUID), the client-side dedup logic in `ensureProfile()`, `loadUserData()`, and `renderConfirmAuth()` correctly queried for existing accounts by email/phone — but **RLS blocked the queries**. The `customer_read_own` policy (`profile_id = auth.uid()`) prevented the new auth user from seeing the existing customer record linked to the old UUID.
- **Fix:** Created `claim_existing_customer` Postgres RPC function (`SECURITY DEFINER`) that bypasses RLS. It checks: profile_id match → email orphan → email cross-link → phone match, then repoints `profile_id` to the current auth user. All three client-side dedup code paths now call this RPC instead of direct table queries.
- **Migration:** `add_claim_existing_customer_rpc` — also added `idx_customers_email_cache` index for fast email lookups.
- Merged additional duplicates found during session: Baby Lee (152+1 orders), Dallas Butler (again — 4th shell!), David test account.

**Same-day delivery date picker fix:**
- The delivery date picker's `min` attribute was set to pickup date + 1 day, physically preventing same-day delivery selection via the Edit button. This blocked David from moving Nicolas Rodet's delivery to tonight.
- **Fix:** Changed `min` to pickup same day. The slot-level validation in `opSaveRouteAndSlot` (delivery start must be after pickup window end) is the real guard — the +1 day constraint was redundant and overly restrictive.

**$20 signup promo credit audit and correction:**
- **Problem 1 — Duplicate signups got $20 each time:** The `apply_signup_promo_credit` trigger checks `signup_promo_credit_at IS NULL` on the customer record, but duplicate shell accounts had their own fresh NULL, so each signup triggered another $20.
- **Problem 2 — Merges lost credits:** When shell accounts were merged into keepers, `customer_transactions` FK references moved but the shell's `credits` balance was not added to the keeper's balance.
- **Audit results:** 231 customers under-credited (should have $20, had $0), 11 customers over-credited (got promo 2-5×), 82 legacy Starchup credits (legitimate, no action needed).
- **Fix:** Restored $20 for all 231 under-credited customers. Normalized 11 over-credited to exactly 1× $20 with `credit_remove` transactions logged for audit trail. Dallas Butler $40→$20, Virginia Kiley/Rachel Lederman already at $20 (excess txns balanced). Robin Kline $0→$10 (partial credit restored).
- **Final state:** 0 under-credited, 403 correct (up from 167), 85 legacy over-credited (legitimate Starchup balances).

**Customer merges (session 74 cont'd):**
- Ecole Bilingue de Berkeley → Anais Wilson (1 order, 1 address, 1 card, 1 txn, 2 sms, 5 emails moved; Anais's phone preserved)
- Charlene Bachemin → Charlene Davis (1 sms moved)
- Baby Lee shell → keeper (1 order, 1 address, 1 sms, 1 email moved)
- Dallas Butler shell → keeper (1 card, 1 txn, 1 sms, 1 email moved) — 4th duplicate!
- David test account deleted (1 sms moved to real account)
- Ambiguous duplicates kept separate per David's decision: Myra Greene / Sarang Rahmani (different people, same phone)

**Files changed:** `customer-app/index.html`, `admin-dashboard/index.html`, `PROJECT-NOTES.md`

**Database changes:**
- Migration: `add_claim_existing_customer_rpc` — new RPC function + email index
- Data fix: 242 customer credit balances corrected, 12 `credit_remove` transactions logged

### Mar 28, 2026 (session 73) — OTP progressive fallback flow, Supabase Disk IO cleanup

**Customer app — OTP progressive fallback flow:**
- #1 customer complaint was OTP failures: no SMS received, expired tokens, invalid tokens. Previously, the OTP verify screen offered only "Resend code" and "Try a different number" — no email escape route.
- Implemented timed progressive reveal: clean OTP input initially, "Resend code" fades in at 15s, email magic-link fallback at 30s. Uses `fadeSlideIn` CSS animation.
- Email fallback sends via existing `send-magic-link` edge function with inline success confirmation.
- "Need help? Text HELP to (510) 588-4102" support shortcut added to hero and OTP screens with `sms:` deep link.
- Timers managed by `startOtpFallbackTimers()` / `clearOtpFallbackTimers()`, triggered from `showAuthPanel()`.

**Supabase Disk IO Budget fix:**
- David received Supabase warning email about depleting Disk IO Budget.
- Diagnosed: `net._http_response` was 8,408 KB for only 45 rows (massive bloat from unvacuumed HTTP response storage). `addresses` table had 166% dead tuples and had never been vacuumed.
- Cleaned `_http_response` (deleted old rows) — shrunk from 8,408 KB → 3,216 KB.
- VACUUMed 6 tables: `addresses`, `customer_transactions`, `customer_payment_methods`, `conversations`, `drivers`, `_http_response`.
- Ongoing IO drivers: `reoptimize_active_routes()` cron every 5 min, CloudPRNT polling every ~5s. Not changed — acceptable load but worth monitoring.

**Recurring order skip fix (regression from session 70i):**
- Root cause: Session 70i changed admin/driver skips to set actual actor in `cancelled_by` (for attribution), but forgot to update `trg_create_recurring_order_fn` which still checked `cancelled_by = 'customer'`. Admin/driver skips on recurring orders silently broke the subscription chain.
- Fix: Removed `cancelled_by` condition from the trigger — any skip on a recurring order now creates the next occurrence regardless of who skipped it.
- Issues tab updated: skipped recurring orders excluded (auto-continue, not actionable). Non-recurring skipped orders from admin/driver still show.
- Data repair: Created Lodestar Campus order #1071 (weekly, pickup Apr 4) — the missed next occurrence.

**Commits:**
- `eed940c` — feat: add progressive OTP fallback flow to reduce auth churn
- `[local]` — fix: recurring order trigger, OTP cleanup, Issues tab filter

**Files changed:** `customer-app/index.html`, `admin-dashboard/index.html`

**DB changes applied (execute_sql):** `trg_create_recurring_order_fn` updated — removed `cancelled_by = 'customer'` condition

**Pending (carries forward):**
1. Receipt template — iPad POS cache clear needed
2. Small "v" character at top of receipt
3. Patricia Carroll — no email, needs manual phone call for $68.95 (order #770)
4. Stripe webhook — verify `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches Stripe Dashboard signing secret
5. Monitor Disk IO budget after today's cleanup — if it recurs, consider reducing CloudPRNT poll frequency

### Mar 28, 2026 (session 72) — Driver uniqueness guard, customer dedup fix, stripe-webhook diagnostics

**Driver app — profile_id uniqueness guard (Known Issue #21 closed):**
- Added UNIQUE constraint on `drivers.profile_id` via migration `drivers_profile_id_unique`. Verified 0 existing duplicates before applying.
- Changed auto-create fallback (line 1764) from `INSERT` to `UPSERT` with `onConflict: 'profile_id'`. Even if two browser tabs race, only one driver record is created.

**Customer app — phone-based account matching (root cause fix for duplicate accounts):**
- Root cause: 4 customer-creation paths in the customer app (`ensureProfile`, `loadUserData`, `handleNameSubmit`, `placeOrder`) only matched by email. If a Starchup-migrated customer signed up with a different email, no path found them → duplicate customer created.
- Fix: Added `_findCustomerByPhone(phone)` helper that calls the existing `find_customer_by_phone` DB RPC (last-10-digit matching), then fetches the full customer record.
- Added phone-based matching as step 2c in `ensureProfile` (after email orphan + cross-link lookups fail, before creating a new record). Backfills name/email/referral only if the existing record has blank fields.
- Added phone-based fallback in `loadUserData` for email-signup users (runs after email-based linking, before customer creation).
- Added email + phone matching to `handleNameSubmit` path (was only checking `profile_id` before).
- Matching cascade is now: profile_id → email (orphan) → email (cross-linked) → **phone** → create new.

**stripe-webhook — diagnostic logging (v26 deployed):**
- Investigated 400 "Invalid signature" errors in edge function logs. Code is correct — this is a configuration issue.
- Most likely cause: stale `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Supabase Secrets (e.g., if the signing secret was rotated in Stripe Dashboard). David confirmed most failures are CVC mismatches, meaning these are legitimate `payment_intent.payment_failed` events from the Family Laundry Stripe account that can't be verified.
- Deployed v26 with pre-verification diagnostic logging: logs event type, account, and livemode before signature check. On 400, also logs the signature prefix. Next occurrence will identify the exact source.
- **Action needed:** David to compare `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Supabase Secrets against the signing secret shown in Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks for the endpoint.

**Commits:**
- `ba7c8c6` — fix: prevent duplicate accounts + driver records, add stripe-webhook diagnostics

**Edge functions deployed:** `stripe-webhook` v26

**DB migrations applied:** `drivers_profile_id_unique` (UNIQUE constraint on `drivers.profile_id`)

**Files changed:** `customer-app/index.html`, `driver-app/index.html`, `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts`

**Pending (carries forward):**
1. Receipt template — iPad POS cache clear needed
2. Small "v" character at top of receipt
3. Patricia Carroll — no email, needs manual phone call for $68.95 (order #770)
4. Stripe webhook — verify `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches Stripe Dashboard signing secret

### Mar 27, 2026 (session 71) — Daily Check engine, recurring order dedup, duplicate stop fixes

**Daily Check engine (admin Overview page):**
- New "Daily Check" card at top of Overview — button-triggered, runs 10 audit checks in parallel via Supabase queries.
- Checks: unrouted orders (P0), wrong-date stops (P0), unpaid delivered orders (P0), stop/order desync (P1), duplicate customers (P1), duplicate orders (P1), over-capacity routes (P1), driverless routes next 7 days (P2), SMS opt-out desync (P2), orphaned records (P3).
- Results display with P0–P3 severity badges, issue counts, detail rows (up to 5 per check), and collapsible "passed" section.
- `DC_SKIP_PHONES` constant excludes known intentional duplicate phone numbers from the duplicate customer check.

**Recurring order duplicate prevention (DB fix):**
- Root cause: `trg_create_recurring_order_fn` created next orders without checking if customer already had a scheduled order for the target date. If a customer booked manually via the app before the trigger fired on delivery, they'd get duplicates.
- Fix: Added COUNT check before INSERT — if customer already has a `scheduled` order on the same Pacific-date pickup, trigger returns silently. Applied via `execute_sql`.
- Cleaned up 3 duplicate order pairs: #968, #1008, #1043 deleted.

**Duplicate route stop prevention (DB + admin fix):**
- Root cause A: `auto_route_order()` created pickup/delivery stops without checking for existing non-skipped/non-failed stops on the same order+type. When `delivery_run_id` was NULL and then set, a second stop could be created.
- Root cause B: Admin `opSaveRouteAndSlot` used `.maybeSingle()` which returns error (not data) when multiple rows match, causing null destructuring → creating yet another stop.
- DB fix: Added existence guards in `auto_route_order()` — checks for non-skipped/non-failed stops before each INSERT.
- Admin fix: Changed `.maybeSingle()` → `.limit(1)` with explicit array destructuring in `opSaveRouteAndSlot` (both pickup and delivery blocks).
- Cleaned up: 4 duplicate delivery stops on orders #817 and #863. 2 ghost stops on order #1012 set to 'skipped'. Franklin Zuniga duplicate order #1061 deleted.

**Data cleanup performed:**
- Deleted orders: #968, #1008, #1043 (recurring duplicates), #1061 (manual duplicate).
- Deleted 4 duplicate delivery stops (orders #817, #863).
- Set 2 ghost stops on order #1012 to `skipped`.

**Commits:**
- `5ac9323` — fix: add same-date dedup check to recurring order trigger
- `b7082c6` — fix: prevent duplicate route stops + dedup guards in auto_route_order
- `bec6529` — feat: add Daily Check engine to admin Overview page

**Files changed:** `admin-dashboard/index.html`, DB functions (`trg_create_recurring_order_fn`, `auto_route_order`) via `execute_sql`

**Pending (carries forward):**
1. Receipt template — iPad POS cache clear needed
2. Small "v" character at top of receipt
3. Patricia Carroll — no email, needs manual phone call for $68.95 (order #770)
4. Tech debt: driver app line 1764 auto-create fallback needs `profile_id` uniqueness guard
5. Investigate stripe-webhook 400 errors (invalid signature)
6. Root cause: duplicate account creation — customer app creates new accounts for existing Starchup-migrated customers

---

### Mar 27, 2026 (session 70i) — Skip attribution, customer tip, issue tracking, CloudPRNT fix

**Skip attribution fix (3 apps):**
- Admin dashboard: `cancelled_by` changed from `'customer'` → `'admin'` in `opSkipOrder()`, status dropdown, and `setSingleOrderStatus()`. Added `logOrderEvent()` to the skip button so skips appear in History tab.
- Driver app: `cancelled_by` changed from `'customer'` → `'driver'` in skip handler.
- Customer app: verified already correct (`'customer'`).

**Default tip in customer app:**
- Added tip UI to Account → Payment Method: $/% toggle + numeric input + Save button.
- New functions `setCustomerTipType()` and `saveCustomerTip()` write to `default_tip` and `default_tip_type` on the customer record — same fields the admin dashboard reads.

**LaChar Burns stats backfill:**
- Updated lifetime_value ($1,170.90), total_orders (+2), referral_source, and notes with full Starchup legacy breakdown (order #2088524).

**Issue tracking system (full feature):**
- `cs_issues` + `cs_issue_comments` tables (migration already existed from previous session).
- Issue detail slide-over panel: meta grid, timeline, comment input, resolve/reopen actions.
- 3 creation entry points: Overview "+ New Issue" button, customer profile "⚑ Issue" button, inbox (updated with category + created_by).
- Inline assignment editing (click to change, logs to audit trail).
- Inline priority editing (dropdown, logs to audit trail).
- Categories: pickup, delivery, billing, damaged, schedule, complaint, other.
- Issue rows on Overview now open detail panel instead of navigating to inbox.

**CloudPRNT edge function fix (v14 → v15 deployed):**
- v13 served raw Star Markup XML as `text/vnd.star.markup` — mC-Print3 firmware 5.2 rejected it.
- v14 used Epson ESC/POS commands (GS !, ESC a, GS V, GS k) — printed as garbled text ("!" before bold, "V" at top, raw barcode bytes as ASCII).
- v15 rewrote converter to Star Line Mode: ESC E/F (bold), ESC GS a (alignment), ESC i (sizing), ESC d (cut), ESC b (barcodes). Added `UNICODE_MAP` for thermal printer ASCII compatibility. Receipts now print correctly.
- Cleared 65 stuck pending print jobs. Printer resumed polling after delay (had backed off from v13 failures).

**Receipt template overhaul (`buildStarMarkup` + both print paths):**
- Header: `www.familylaundry.com` replaces street address.
- Customer name: double-size (2:2) bold, max 12 chars. Address + phone shown.
- Route names: `PU: OAKLAND AM` / `DL: OAKLAND PM` in large bold font.
- Weight always shown: `- LBS / - BAGS` when unknown.
- Footer: "Questions? email info@familylaundry.com"
- Both print paths now fetch pickup + delivery stops in one query (`.in('stop_type', ['pickup', 'delivery'])`).

**QA review — error handling fix:**
- `saveAssignment()` and `changeIssuePriority()` now check DB response for errors and show error toast on failure (previously fire-and-forget with success toast regardless).

**Registration stats:** 9 new customers on 3/26, 8 on 3/27 (excluding migration/link accounts).

**Edge functions deployed:** `cloudprnt` v15
**Files changed:** `admin-dashboard/index.html`, `driver-app/index.html`, `customer-app/index.html`, `supabase/functions/cloudprnt/index.ts`

**Pending (carries forward):**
1. Receipt template — iPad POS needs cache clear (Settings > Safari > Clear Website Data) to pick up new template. Old template still cached on-site iPad.
2. Small "v" character at top of receipt — cosmetic, not yet investigated.
3. Patricia Carroll — no email, needs manual phone call for $68.95 (order #770)
4. Tech debt: driver app line 1764 auto-create fallback needs `profile_id` uniqueness guard
5. Investigate stripe-webhook 400 errors (invalid signature)
6. Root cause: duplicate account creation — customer app creates new accounts for existing Starchup-migrated customers

---

### Mar 27, 2026 (session 70h) — Billing retry flow refinement, audit fixes, driver duplicate fix

**Billing retry flow — prevent repeated failed charges (charge-order v26 + admin UI):**
- **Problem:** When a card charge failed, admin saw "Retry charge" with no way to know the card had already been tried and declined. Admins kept retrying → customers received multiple failure notifications (Anna Bellomo had 15).
- **New `charge_failed_at` column** on `orders` table (TIMESTAMPTZ). Set by `charge-order` v26 on decline; cleared on successful charge.
- **charge-order v26 deployed:** On failure, sets `billing_status='failed'` + `charge_failed_at = NOW()`. On success, sets `billing_status='paid'` + `billed_at` + clears `charge_failed_at`.
- **Admin UI 3-way button logic:** Compares `charge_failed_at` vs `customer_payment_methods.created_at` to determine card staleness. Stale card → "📞 Update card" (with customer name/phone toast). Fresh card or never tried → "Retry charge". No card → "Request card".
- **Realtime listener:** INSERT on `customer_payment_methods` updates `_custCardAddedAt` Map in real time — when customer adds a new card, admin UI auto-switches from "Update card" to "Retry charge" without page refresh.
- **Backfill:** Audited all 10 `billing_status='failed'` orders with cards on file. Checked SMS history — all had payment failure notifications sent AFTER cards were added (confirming cards were already retried and declined). Set `charge_failed_at = NOW()` on orders 203, 272, 430, 753, 816, 830, 857, 867, 872, 890.
- **`retryChargeFromIssues()` catch block** now calls `loadOrders()` on failure so UI immediately picks up the new `charge_failed_at` and switches to "Update card".

**Daily audit fixes:**
- **Wrong-date stops:** Moved order #543 stops to correct routes. Orders #642 and #707 (terminal: cancelled/skipped) cleaned up as ghost stops.
- **Ghost stops:** Set 7 orphaned stops to correct terminal status matching their parent orders.
- **Duplicate orders:** Deleted $0 stale scheduled orders for Kevin McLaughlin and Elizabeth Gordon. Erin Colcord's two orders (#841, #968) flagged for David — different bag counts, may both be intentional.

**Luis/Hayward driver app fix:**
- **Symptom:** Stops not showing on Luis's driver app after route reassignment from John.
- **Root cause:** Duplicate driver record (`6af83112...`) created today alongside original (`2c642af8...`). Both had same `profile_id`. Driver app resolved to the new empty record while routes were assigned to the original.
- **Fix:** Merged data and deleted duplicate driver record. Stops now visible.
- **Tech debt flagged:** Driver app line 1764 auto-creates driver records without checking for existing records with same `profile_id` (race condition). Needs uniqueness guard.

**Root-cause rule added to WashRoute skills:**
- New mandatory rule: every one-time data fix must be accompanied by a root-cause code fix. Added to both `washroute` and `washroute-audit` skill files.

**Edge functions deployed:** `charge-order` v26
**DB changes:** Added `charge_failed_at` TIMESTAMPTZ column to `orders` table. Backfilled 10 failed orders.
**Files changed:** `admin-dashboard/index.html`, `supabase/functions/charge-order/index.ts`

**Pending (carries forward):**
1. David needs to run `git push` from Terminal (VM can't authenticate with GitHub)
2. Erin Colcord duplicate orders (#841 and #968 for Mar 30) — David to decide if both intentional
3. ~~Tech debt: driver app line 1764 auto-create fallback needs `profile_id` uniqueness guard~~ ✅ Resolved session 111
4. Re-enable `review_request` and `reorder_reminder` SMS templates when ready
5. ~~Credits not applied at charge time — only at Intake.~~ ✅ Resolved session 111 (charge-order v34)

### Mar 26, 2026 (session 70g) — Customer merge, CloudPRNT receipt overhaul, order history logging

- **Customer merge: Melanie Petersen duplicates resolved.** Two Melanie Petersen records merged into one. Moved orders, SMS, addresses, and profile/Stripe/card data from the duplicate (created Mar 23 via new app signup) to the primary (174 legacy orders, $1,204.70 LTV). Deleted duplicate $0 orders that overlapped on the same pickup dates (Mar 24 and Mar 31). Recalculated `total_orders` (176) and `lifetime_value` ($1,273.65) accounting for both legacy stats and new orders.

- **CloudPRNT edge function rewritten (v13 deployed):** Root cause of garbled receipts found — the edge function had a hand-rolled `parseMarkupToEscPos()` converter that was mangling Star Document Markup into raw ESC/POS bytes. The mC-Print3 supports Star Markup natively. Replaced the entire function: now serves `text/vnd.star.markup` content type with raw XML, letting the printer handle fonts, barcodes, alignment, encoding. Removed ~150 lines of ESC/POS conversion code. Fixes: "0" before FAMILY LAUNDRY (ESC/POS byte 0x30 misinterpreted), "ûï" garbage (UTF-8 middot bytes in wrong charset), barcode not rendering (was skipped in converter), "447447" duplicate (barcode HRI + text-line both printing).

- **Receipt markup improvements (`buildStarMarkup` in admin-dashboard):**
  - Replaced Unicode middots (`·`) with ASCII `/` and `@` for printer safety
  - Added zip code: "2609 Foothill Blvd, Oakland CA 94601"
  - Added customer phone number to receipt header
  - Fixed barcode: `hri="none"` + duplicate text-line → single `hri="below"`
  - Changed `— INVOICE —` em dashes to ASCII `-- INVOICE --`
  - Now prints **two copies** (bag tag + customer file) — previously CloudPRNT only printed one
  - Updated Settings dropdown label: "Star TSP654II" → "Star mC-Print3"
  - Same fixes applied to PassPRNT and browser transports for consistency

- **Order history tab + `logOrderEvent` wiring:** Already built in session 70d, this session confirmed all `logOrderEvent` calls are correctly placed BEFORE their corresponding DB updates (so if the update fails, the event still records the attempt). 30+ event insertion points cover: status changes (advance, rollback, on-hold), reschedules (pickup/delivery dates, recurrence changes, address changes, route reassignment), detail changes (weight, bags, total), billing (card charges, cash/check/Venmo payments), intake processing, fold assignment, rack assignment, and kanban drag-back. QA confirmed `order_events` table schema matches, `currentUserFirstName` fallback to 'Admin' works, and all event descriptions are properly escaped.

- **QA fixes:** Changed `opLoadHistory()` from `.select('*')` to explicit columns. No high/medium issues found.

**Edge functions deployed:** `cloudprnt` v13
**DB changes:** None (customer merge via DML only)
**Files changed:** `admin-dashboard/index.html`, `supabase/functions/cloudprnt/index.ts`

---

### Mar 26, 2026 (session 70f) — Phone required on signup, registration time widget, phone-missing email blast

- **Phone number now required on all registration paths:** Added JS-level validation (min 10 digits) to the email sign-up form (`handleSignup`), the in-checkout sign-up form (`placeOrder`), and a safety guard on the OTP name-collection panel (`handleNameSubmit`). Also added HTML `required` attribute to checkout phone input. Previously, email-signup users could create accounts without a phone number — 12 out of ~700 customers had no phone on file.
- **New Customers widget shows registration time:** "Joined" column now shows "Mar 26 · 2:34 pm" instead of just "Mar 26", so David can see exactly when each customer signed up. Uses `BIZ_TZ` for Pacific time consistency.
- **Phone-missing email blast:** Sent personalized email to all 12 customers with email but no phone number, urging them to add their mobile via the app. Sent via `pg_net` → `send-email` edge function. All 12 returned HTTP 200. Email includes app link (https://app.familylaundry.com/), instructions to go to Account → add phone → Save, and auto-appended unsubscribe footer.
- **CC Holland account deletion:** Guided David through manual SQL in Supabase SQL Editor (MCP was down after blast campaign). Required deleting FK-referencing tables first (conversations, sms_messages, email_messages, addresses) before customers row. CC re-registered with a fresh account.

**Commits:** `7fdae10` (registration time widget), `4a371b8` (phone required on signup)
**DB changes:** None
**Files changed:** `admin-dashboard/index.html`, `customer-app/index.html`

---

### Mar 26, 2026 (session 70e) — Launch blast campaign, driver photo queue, date formatting, OTP triage

- **Launch campaign blast sent:** 559 SMS + 318 emails to remaining active customers who hadn't been contacted yet. Filtered out: already-contacted, retail (2609 Foothill), inactive since Jan 2025. Sent via `pg_net` → `send-sms`/`send-email` edge functions (VM couldn't reach external URLs directly). Email parameter fix: corrected `to`→`to_email` and `html`→`body` for `send-email` edge function.
- **Follow-up trigger confirmed live:** `apply_signup_promo_credit()` trigger on `customer_payment_methods` INSERT already handles: $20 credit + "You're all set!" email + SMS. 308 customers have received the credit as of this session. Deadline: Monday March 30 midnight PT.
- **Driver photo queue — capture-now-upload-later:** Replaced blocking upload with background queue. Photos compressed via canvas (1200px max, 80% JPEG). Stored in IndexedDB, uploaded in background with 30s retry. Complete button unlocks immediately. Amber pending-count badge on Route nav. Queue survives app restart.
- **Year added to `fmtDate()`:** All admin date displays now show year (e.g. "Mar 26, 2026"). Single-line fix in shared utility function.
- **OTP investigation:** 19 customers complained about "token expired" in last 3 days. Root cause: Supabase OTP expiry was set to 60 seconds — too short for most users to switch apps and type the code. David changed to 300 seconds in dashboard. 51 users never confirmed (7.4%), 41 confirmed on a different day. 2 unreplied complaints found (Katharine Boyle, Ayse Sercan) — sent template reply with instructions + email login alternative.

**Commits:** `9e94015` (fmtDate year fix), `0bc2dfc` (driver photo queue)
**DB changes:** None (OTP expiry changed in Supabase dashboard, not SQL)
**Files changed:** `admin-dashboard/index.html`, `driver-app/index.html`

**Pending (carries forward):**
- Fix Supabase dashboard test phone number format to save 300s OTP expiry (field needs `phone=OTP` format, not bare number)
- Re-enable `review_request` / `reorder_reminder` SMS templates
- Resolve 38+ unpaid orders, 78 orphaned profiles, 29 duplicate addresses
- Phase 1 smart scheduler
- XSS hardening
- Wire driver app + edge functions to insert `order_events`

---

### Mar 26, 2026 (session 70d) — Order History feature, logOrderEvent wiring, SMS timestamps

- **PM→next-morning-AM routing bug fixed:** `auto_route_order()` now guards against PM pickups being scheduled for next-morning AM delivery. If pickup ≥ 12:00 AND delivery < 12:00 AND delivery_date ≤ pickup_date + 1, delivery shifts to PM. Sub-window capacity overflow also fixed — WHILE loop now iterates through all sub-windows instead of giving up after the first full one. 11 Oakland orders unblocked.
- **`order_events` table created:** Full audit log with `event_type`, `description`, `old_value`/`new_value`, `actor_name`, and `created_at`. Indexed on `(order_id, created_at)`. RLS: read/insert for all.
- **`log_order_change()` trigger deployed:** AFTER UPDATE on orders. Captures status, weight, bags, total, folded_by, racked, routed, billing, rescheduled — each section has 3-second dedup. `log_order_created()` trigger logs new orders.
- **`logOrderEvent()` JS helper:** Inserts event with admin's `currentUserFirstName` BEFORE the DB update. Trigger dedup skips when JS already logged it — preserves admin attribution.
- **18 admin actions wired:** `opSaveRouteAndSlot`, `_opShiftDeliveryWindow`, `selectSpSlot`, `confirmReassignRun`, `opSaveOrderDetails`, `saveIntake`, `opChargeOrder`, `confirmBilling` (card + alt), `saveFolding`, `assignFolderInline`, `saveRacking`, `batchSetStatus`, `batchAdvanceStatus`, `updateOrderStatus`, `moveOrderBack`, `opSaveAddress`, `opToggleDiffDeliveryAddr`, `opSaveRecurring`.
- **History tab added to order panel:** 4th tab with emoji-coded timeline, lazy-loaded, cached per order.
- **4,926 events backfilled** from existing order data (timestamps from `created_at`, `actual_pickup_at`, `actual_delivery_at`, `folded_at`, `racked_at`, `paid_at`, `updated_at`).
- **FK constraint dropped on `order_events.actor_id`:** `folded_by_id` references launderers not in `profiles` table — FK was causing crashes when assigning folders in Processing queue.
- **Dedup added to folded/racked trigger sections:** Previously had no dedup, causing duplicate events.
- **SMS timestamps on Engagement page:** Message History now shows "Mar 25 · 2:34 pm" instead of just "Mar 25".
- **Oliver Said's account deleted** (0 orders, inactive legacy customer).

**Commits:** `d77c583` (logOrderEvent wiring + backfill), `3f7f3c7` (SMS timestamps)
**DB changes:** `order_events` table, `log_order_change()` trigger (updated), `log_order_created()` trigger, FK dropped on `actor_id`
**Files changed:** `admin-dashboard/index.html`

### Mar 26, 2026 (session 70) — Kidango cleanup, duplicate merge, UTC→Pacific timezone audit round 2

**Kidango account removal:**
- Identified and removed 16 Kidango childcare center accounts (Starchup migration data). None had Stripe, profiles, or SMS. Deleted 16 customers, 12 orders ($0, never charged), 24 route stops, 16 addresses. Preflight confirmed zero SMS risk.

**Duplicate account merge (5 groups):**
- Sandeep Vadivel, Amber Holden (was "Jessica Leak"), Franklin Zuniga, Michael Bernasek, Shaina Sherer — all classic Starchup shell + new customer app signup pairs. Winner scored by orders/Stripe/profile. SMS, addresses, orders moved to winner; loser deleted. Profile and Stripe transferred where winner lacked them. Franklin's name corrected from "Lodestar" to "Franklin Zuniga".
- 3 groups intentionally skipped (same as session 66): David's test accounts, Myra Greene/Sarang Rahmani (different people), Charlene Davis/Charlene Bachemin (uncertain match).

**UTC→Pacific timezone audit — 18 bugs fixed (commit `2579fa7`):**

Session 67 caught 45+ timezone bugs but these 18 slipped through. All were cases of bare `.getHours()`, `.getDay()`, `.getDate()`, `.toDateString()`, or `setHours(0,0,0,0)` on `new Date()` without converting to Pacific first.

*Admin Dashboard (11 fixes):*
- 3× `msSinceMidnight` for route window lock timing — bare `getHours()/getMinutes()` → Pacific via `toLocaleString('en-US', { timeZone: BIZ_TZ })`
- 3× `todayDow` for day-of-week checks (route badges, schedule grid, driver popover) — bare `getDay()` → Pacific
- 2× `toDateString()` comparisons for "is today" schedule highlighting → `toLocaleDateString('en-CA', { timeZone: BIZ_TZ })`
- 2× `todayMidnight.setHours(0,0,0,0)` → replaced with Pacific date string comparison
- 1× laundry history date range query — browser-local midnight → dynamic Pacific UTC offset

*Customer App (5 fixes):*
- `localIso()` function — used UTC `getFullYear()/getMonth()/getDate()` → now uses `toLocaleDateString('en-CA', { timeZone: BIZ_TZ })`
- `fmtSlot()` compact function — bare `getHours()` → Pacific-converted
- `buildActiveCard()` — 2× bare `getHours()` for pickup time display → Pacific
- `_winFromOrder()` — bare `getHours()` for edit schedule start/end minutes → Pacific

*Driver App (1 fix):*
- `fmtMsgTime()` "isToday" check — `toDateString()` → Pacific `toLocaleDateString`

*Edge functions: CLEAN — no issues found.*

**Files changed:** `admin-dashboard/index.html`, `customer-app/index.html`, `driver-app/index.html`

**Session 70b — continued same day:**

**Unpaid Delivered Orders panel (admin Overview page, commit `3816069`):**
- New "Unpaid Delivered Orders" card on the Overview page. Shows all orders with status delivered/ready_for_delivery/out_for_delivery where `billing_status != 'paid'`. Color-coded badges: FAILED (red), REFUNDED (purple), UNPAID (amber). Clickable rows open order detail panel. Counter shows total count + outstanding dollar amount. Appears between Open Issues and Recurring Orders sections.

**Email duplicate merge — 71 pairs:**
- Merged 71 email-based duplicate customer pairs (in addition to the 5 phone-based pairs from earlier in session 70). Pattern: ghost accounts from email signup with 0-1 orders and no phone, alongside active accounts with orders + phone. All FK records (orders, addresses, conversations, payment methods, transactions, email messages, SMS messages, notifications, subscriptions, CS issues) transferred to winner. Profiles NULLed on losers first to avoid unique constraint, then transferred to winners where winner had none. Names transferred where winner was blank.
- Special overrides per David: Kelly Thompson phone → (510) 387-1272; Risa → Rita Hidalgo; Bethel Berkeley → "Front Administrator"; Ecole Bilingue de Berkeley kept; Level Up Wellness merged to business name; Ruth MacNaughton merged (same phone, different formats).
- Post-merge verification: 0 remaining email dupes (down from 71), 0 desynced stops, 0 unintended SMS sent.

**Wrong-date stop cleanup — 7 stops:**
- 4 orders (#199 Rae MaxwellRoss, #260 Dominic Volpatti, #245 Emily Buddeke, #707 Rachelle Greenfield) had delivery stops on wrong-date routes. All were cancelled/skipped orders with pending stops. Set to skipped.

**Desynced stop cleanup — 33 stops:**
- 33 route stops had pending/en_route status while their parent orders were cancelled/skipped/delivery_failed. Set to skipped (31) or failed (2, for delivery_failed orders).

**Daily health audit skill installed:**
- New `washroute-audit` skill with 10 SQL checks: unrouted orders, wrong-date stops, unpaid delivered orders, stop/order desync, duplicate customers, duplicate orders, over-capacity routes, driverless routes, SMS opt-out sync, orphaned records. Triggers on "load up", "morning rounds", "run audit". First run caught all the issues fixed above.

**Session 70c — continued same day:**

**⚠️ CRITICAL FIX — $20 promo credit trigger deadline was stale:**
- The `trg_signup_promo_credit` trigger (on `customer_payment_methods` INSERT) had a hardcoded deadline of `2026-03-24 00:00:00 PT` (Monday March 23 midnight). This was the ORIGINAL deadline from session 48 launch. Although the project notes recorded deadline extensions to Tuesday and then Friday, **the actual trigger function was never updated** — it still used the March 24 cutoff.
- Result: every customer who added a card after March 24 got silently skipped — no $20 credit, no confirmation email, no confirmation SMS.
- **Fix:** Updated `apply_signup_promo_credit()` function deadline to `2026-03-31 00:00:00 PT` (next Monday March 30 midnight). Future card-adds will now correctly receive the $20 promo.
- **Backfill:** Identified 55 customers who added cards between March 24–26 and received $0 credit. Applied $20 credit to all 55 accounts ($1,100 total), set `signup_promo_credit_at`, and logged `credit_add` transactions with note "Launch promo backfill". These customers did NOT receive the confirmation email/SMS that the trigger normally sends — they just got the credit silently. David may want to send a follow-up.

**Chelle Schauben duplicate merge:**
- Merged "Chelle y" (chelleland@gmail.com, 1 order, $0, created today) into "Chelle Schauben" (same email, 94 cached orders → 1 actual non-cancelled order after recount). Transferred order #927 ($68.95, scheduled). Deleted duplicate + orphaned profile.

**Nudge SMS feature (admin Overview → New Customers panel):**
- New "Nudge" button on new customers who haven't placed an order yet and have a phone number
- Sends personalized SMS: "Hi {name}, this is {sender} from Family Laundry. Can I help you place your first order with us? Have any questions?"
- **Dynamic sender name:** Uses `currentUserFirstName` from the logged-in admin/manager's profile (David, Luis, John, or Lili). Not hardcoded.
- Button shows "✓ Nudged" after send. "No phone" shown for customers without phone_cache.
- Reply goes to SMS inbox like any other customer message.
- Verified: nudge to Ellen Mulberg sent successfully (status: accepted, Twilio delivered).

**Overview page cleanup (commits `dae50ef` through `a4c8390`):**
- Removed stat cards (Expected Orders/Bags/Revenue Today) — cluttered, not actionable
- Removed Recurring Orders panel — rarely used, cluttered
- Made New Customers and Recent Orders panels collapsible (default closed)
- Added 24h stat badges: signups, orders placed in last 24 hours
- Added conversion % badge: shows what percentage of all registered customers have placed at least one order (green ≥50%, amber <50%)
- CTA text "Show last 10 ▸" / "Hide ▾" replaces old expand button
- Unpaid Delivered Orders panel: filters out refunded orders, adds Retry/Request Card action buttons using existing `_deliveredActionBtn()` pattern

**Pending (carries forward):**
1. Re-send campaign emails to ~3,475 unreached customers (session 68 emails failed due to wrong params)
2. Continue campaign SMS to ~1,846 unreached customers
3. Re-enable `review_request` and `reorder_reminder` SMS templates
4. Resolve 42 unpaid delivered orders (now visible on Overview page — ranges $48.95–$204.95, mix of failed/null/refunded billing_status)
5. Oakland AM over capacity (36 stops vs 30 limit) — move 6 stops or raise limit
6. 78 orphaned profiles (customer role, no linked customer record) — clean up
7. 29 duplicate addresses — deduplicate
8. Phase 1 smart scheduler — `route_duration_estimate` + Google API integration
9. Supabase OTP expiry, Cynthia Williams landline, credits not applied after Intake
10. XSS hardening, clean up orphaned auth.users
11. Order mC-Print3 printer
12. **Consider sending confirmation email/SMS to the 55 backfilled customers** — they got the $20 but no notification
13. **$20 promo deadline is now March 30 midnight PT** — verify trigger fires correctly for next card-add

### Mar 25, 2026 (session 69) — SMS/email opt-out sync, email unsubscribe, route capacity fixes, capacity-aware booking, per-sub-window enforcement

**SMS/email marketing opt-out sync (twilio-webhook v28):**
- `sms_consent_at` (Twilio legal compliance, cleared by STOP) and `sms_marketing_opt_out_at` (admin marketing toggle) are now kept in sync. STOP sets both to opted-out; START clears both.
- Backfilled 404 customers who had texted STOP (`sms_consent_at = NULL`) but still showed as marketing-opted-in (`sms_marketing_opt_out_at = NULL`).

**Email unsubscribe system (email-unsubscribe edge function v1, send-email v14):**
- New `email-unsubscribe` edge function: public GET endpoint with HMAC-SHA256 signed tokens so customers can't unsubscribe others by guessing IDs. Sets `email_marketing_opt_out_at`. Returns branded HTML confirmation page.
- `send-email` v14: auto-appends signed unsubscribe footer to every email that has a `customer_id`. Uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for HMAC signing.

**Route assignment bug fix (migration `fix_auto_route_order_capacity_check`):**
- Root cause: `auto_route_order()` counted ALL stops (including completed/skipped/failed) against `stop_limit`, causing false "at capacity" rejections on customer-created orders.
- Fixed to only count `pending`/`en_route` stops.
- Re-routed 7 previously unrouted orders — 2 fixed immediately, 5 were genuinely at capacity.
- Bumped Oakland AM + PM `stop_limit` from 25 to 30 per David's request.

**Capacity-aware booking UX (commit `3ac0b59`):**
- Full slots show red "Full" badge and are disabled. Almost-full (≤5 spots) shows amber "N spots left" badge.
- All-full day shows yellow nudge: "Please pick a different day for faster service."
- Auto-select skips full windows for both pickup and delivery.
- Delivery capacity fetched separately via `_fetchDeliveryCapacity()` (delivery may be on a different date).

**Per-sub-window capacity enforcement (migration `per_sub_window_capacity`, commit `53ce21d`):**
- `stop_limit` on a route template is now divided by the number of sub-windows: `num_sub_windows = FLOOR(total_hours * 60 / step_mins)`, `sub_window_limit = FLOOR(stop_limit / num_sub_windows)`.
- Example: Oakland PM (6–10 PM, 2-hour arrival windows) has 2 sub-windows. A `stop_limit` of 30 → 15 per sub-window.
- `get_slot_availability()` RPC now returns per-sub-window rows with `sub_window_start`, `sub_window_end`, `sub_window_limit`, `active_stops`.
- `auto_route_order()` checks capacity within the specific sub-window the order falls into.
- Customer app `fetchWindowsForDate()` and `_fetchDeliveryCapacity()` key capacity by `"templateId|sub_window_start"`.

**Smart scheduler discussion (not implemented):**
- Phase 1: Add `route_duration_estimate` column updated via Google API when routes change — visibility into how long routes actually take.
- Phase 2: Replace fixed stop limits with time-based capacity checks.
- Agreed on phased approach; nothing built yet.

**Files changed:** `customer-app/index.html`, DB migrations (`fix_auto_route_order_capacity_check`, `add_get_slot_availability_rpc`, `per_sub_window_capacity`), edge functions (`twilio-webhook` v28, `email-unsubscribe` v1, `send-email` v14)

**Pending (carries forward from session 68):**
1. Re-send campaign emails to ~3,475 unreached customers (session 68 emails failed due to wrong params)
2. Continue campaign SMS to ~1,846 unreached customers
3. Re-enable `review_request` and `reorder_reminder` SMS templates
4. Resolve 5 unpaid delivered orders ($567.75)
5. Phase 1 smart scheduler — `route_duration_estimate` + Google API integration
6. Supabase OTP expiry, Cynthia Williams landline, credits not applied after Intake
7. XSS hardening, deduplicate merged addresses, clean up orphaned auth.users/profiles
8. Order mC-Print3 printer

### Mar 25, 2026 (session 68) — Launch campaign extension blast (SMS working, emails need re-send)

**Context:** David extended the $20 credit deadline from Tuesday midnight to Friday midnight Pacific. credit_expires_at already set to `2026-03-28 07:59:59+00` (= Mar 27 11:59:59 PM Pacific, which IS Friday). Remaining ~3,846 unreached non-retail customers need email + SMS with updated deadline.

**$20 credit deadline extension:** Verified existing `credit_expires_at` values were already correct for Friday. No DB update needed — the cron job `expire-migration-credits` runs daily at midnight UTC and zeros credits where `credit_expires_at < now()`.

**SMS sends (batches 1-8 = 2,000 customers):**
- Used `net.http_post()` calling `send-sms` edge function
- SMS body: `"Hi {first_name}, Family Laundry here. Our new ordering app is live! Log in now to update your preferences and payment details: app.familylaundry.com Update by Friday midnight and get $20 in laundry credit, automatically added to your account."`
- Batches 1-4 (~1,000): ~861 succeeded, ~103 rate-limited (Twilio "Too Many Requests"), 1 pending
- Batches 5-8 (~1,000): still in `net._http_response` queue (null status) at time of pause — should process eventually
- Targeting: unreached non-retail customers with `phone_cache IS NOT NULL AND sms_consent_at IS NOT NULL`, ordered by `created_at ASC`, 250 per batch

**Email sends — ALL FAILED (must re-send):**
- Used wrong parameter names in `net.http_post()` payload: sent `to` instead of `to_email`, and `html` instead of `body`
- Edge function `send-email` expects: `{ customer_id, to_email, subject, body }`
- All 2,000 email requests returned 400: `"to_email, subject, and body are required"`
- **Action required next session:** Re-send all emails using correct params. Also include `customer_id` for proper logging.

**Correct blast SQL pattern (for next session):**
```sql
-- EMAIL (correct params):
net.http_post(
  'https://umjpbuxrdydwejqtensq.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-email',
  jsonb_build_object(
    'customer_id', c.id::text,
    'to_email', c.email_cache,
    'subject', 'The new Family Laundry app is live - log in for $20 Credit',
    'body', '<html content here>'
  ), '{}',
  jsonb_build_object(
    'Content-Type', 'application/json',
    'Authorization', 'Bearer <anon_key>'
  )
)

-- SMS (correct — already working):
net.http_post(
  'https://umjpbuxrdydwejqtensq.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-sms',
  jsonb_build_object(
    'to', c.phone_cache,
    'body', 'Hi ' || COALESCE(c.first_name_cache, 'there') || ', Family Laundry here...'
  ), '{}',
  jsonb_build_object(
    'Content-Type', 'application/json',
    'Authorization', 'Bearer <anon_key>'
  )
)
```

**SMS rate limiting note:** Sending 250 SMS in a single SQL batch overwhelms Twilio after ~200. Future batches should either use smaller batch sizes (100-150) or add a delay between batches.

**Campaign totals (all-time, before re-send):**
- Emails: ~1,514 unique customers reached (all from sessions 51-58; zero new from session 68)
- SMS: ~1,397 + up to 2,000 new from session 68 (exact count pending queue drain)
- Unreached (email): ~3,475 customers still need email
- Unreached (SMS): ~2,959 customers still need SMS (some overlap with email-only — 834 have no SMS consent)

**Pending (carries forward):**
1. **Re-send all emails** to the 2,000 customers who got SMS but no email this session — use `to_email` and `body` params
2. **Continue campaign** to remaining ~1,846 unreached customers (email + SMS)
3. Re-enable `review_request` and `reorder_reminder` SMS templates when ready
4. Resolve 5 unpaid delivered orders ($567.75)
5. Consider increasing Supabase OTP expiry
6. Cynthia Williams landline issue
7. Credits not applied at charge time if added after Intake
8. XSS hardening (onclick string interpolation)
9. Deduplicate merged customer addresses
10. Clean up orphaned auth.users/profiles from deleted duplicate customers

**Printer:** David chose Star Micronics mC-Print3 (WiFi+LAN+USB+CloudPRNT) to replace TSP100IIIBI (Bluetooth-only, can't do CloudPRNT). Not yet ordered.

### Mar 25, 2026 (session 67) — Comprehensive UTC timezone audit + fixes

**Trigger:** Customer Kimi Watkins-Tartt reported SMS confirmation showing wrong date vs correct email confirmation. Investigation traced to `fmtDate()` in `send-order-notification` edge function using UTC instead of Pacific. David then requested a full codebase audit: "scour every inch of code for UTC mismatches."

**SMS notification fix (deployed as edge function v22):**
- `fmtDate()` now includes `timeZone: 'America/Los_Angeles'` — was using Deno's UTC default
- Added `fmtTimeWindow()` function to compute pickup/delivery time windows from order timestamps
- Populated `time_window`, `pickup_time_window`, `delivery_time_window`, `bag_count` template variables (were hardcoded empty)

**John Taladiar login fix:**
- "Cannot coerce the result to a single JSON object" — two auth.users accounts (email + phone) for same person, profile linked to phone account only
- Created profile for email account, updated customer record, deleted orphaned phone account

**Map pin color fix:**
- At-risk stops were rendering as red dots on the map, indistinguishable from Hayward route (also red)
- Removed `const pinColor = isAtRisk ? '#dc2626' : color;` — pins now always use route color
- Red LATE warning still shows in popup text and card list badges (David approved this UX)

**Duplicate route stops cleanup:**
- Steven Kral: deleted one of two duplicate stops
- System-wide scan: found 12 customers with duplicate orders on same routes (mostly $0 batch-imported migration orders)
- Scored and deleted 15 stale orders + ~30 stops

**Auto-route window matching bug (migration `fix_auto_route_order_window_matching`):**
- `auto_route_order()` silently assigned orders to wrong time-window routes when matching routes were full (fell through to any route in same zone/day)
- Fixed: FOR loop now restricted to `AND v_pickup_time >= window_start AND v_pickup_time < window_end`
- Found and re-routed 8 mis-routed orders (6 scheduled, 2 already delivered)
- David bumped route limits to 25; force-inserted remaining stragglers

**RCC realtime fix:**
- Map "remaining" count wasn't updating in real time — only had UPDATE handler on route_stops
- Added INSERT and DELETE handlers to route_stops subscription
- Added orders→RCC bridge: order status changes now trigger `rccRefreshRoute()` for affected routes

**Full UTC timezone audit — 45+ bugs fixed across all apps:**

*Admin Dashboard (~15 fixes):*
- Report date filter: `toISOString().split('T')[0]` → `toLocaleDateString('en-CA', {timeZone: BIZ_TZ})`
- AM/PM route selector: `new Date().getHours() < 12` → timezone-aware via `toLocaleString`
- All `toLocaleTimeString()` and `toLocaleString()` calls: added `timeZone: BIZ_TZ`
- Affected: driver location popup, ETA displays, laundry history, receipt, message timestamps

*Customer App (~17 fixes):*
- Added `const BIZ_TZ = 'America/Los_Angeles'` constant
- All `toISOString().split('T')[0]` → `toLocaleDateString('en-CA', {timeZone: BIZ_TZ})`
- All `toLocaleDateString()` / `toLocaleTimeString()`: added `timeZone: BIZ_TZ`
- Affected: booking flow dates, calendar, order display, schedule labels, time formatting

*Driver App (~8 fixes):*
- Added `const BIZ_TZ = 'America/Los_Angeles'` constant
- Fixed `today()` function, `fmtTime()`, `fmtDate()`, greeting `getHours()`, route date header, message timestamps

*optimize-route Edge Function (deployed as v17):*
- Replaced hardcoded `-07:00` (PDT) offset with dynamic PST/PDT-aware computation using Intl
- Was wrong during winter months (Nov–Mar when PST = `-08:00`)

**Prevention rule established:** Every date formatting call must include `timeZone: 'America/Los_Angeles'` (or `BIZ_TZ`). `toISOString().split('T')[0]` is banned — use `toLocaleDateString('en-CA', {timeZone: BIZ_TZ})`. Bare `getHours()` banned for business logic — convert to Pacific first.

**Pending (carries forward from session 66):**
1. Re-enable `review_request` and `reorder_reminder` SMS templates when ready
2. Resolve 5 unpaid delivered orders ($567.75)
3. Consider increasing Supabase OTP expiry
4. Cynthia Williams landline issue
5. Credits not applied at charge time if added after Intake
6. XSS hardening (onclick string interpolation)
7. Deduplicate merged customer addresses
8. Clean up orphaned auth.users/profiles from deleted duplicate customers

### Mar 25, 2026 (session 66) — Customer account deduplication

**Nate Frank — individual merge (manual):**
- Two accounts found: one Starchup migration shell (no orders, no Stripe, no profile) and one active customer app signup with orders, Stripe, and profile.
- Moved SMS and address data from shell to active account, deleted conversations and shell customer record. Verified zero orphaned references.

**System-wide duplicate audit:**
- Ran three parallel detection queries: by email, by phone (last 10 digits), by exact name match.
- Found 41 duplicate groups (88 total accounts). Most were Starchup migration shells paired with new customer app signups for the same person.

**Bulk merge — 38 groups processed:**
- Built automated merge DO block with scoring system: `orders×1000 + has_stripe×100 + has_profile×10 + creation_epoch/1e10` to select the "winner" (most active account) in each group.
- For each pair: moved orders, sms_messages, email_messages, customer_transactions, notifications, subscriptions, cs_issues, addresses to winner. Transferred stripe_customer_id and profile_id from loser→winner when winner lacked them (clearing loser's unique constraint first). Deleted loser's conversations and customer record.
- Payment methods: moved to winner if winner had none, deleted if winner already had payment methods.
- Preflight verified all triggers on affected tables (orders, customer_payment_methods) only fire on INSERT or status/window changes — no SMS blast risk from UPDATE customer_id.

**3 groups intentionally skipped:**
1. David's test accounts (phone `4156085446`, 3 records) — kept for testing.
2. Myra Greene vs Sarang Rahmani (phone `5109270366`) — different people, same phone.
3. Charlene Bachemin vs Charlene Davis (phone `5109270618`) — uncertain match, different last names.

**Errors encountered and resolved during merge iterations:**
- `conversations_customer_id_fkey` — added DELETE FROM conversations before deleting customer.
- `idx_customers_profile_id_unique` — must NULL loser's profile_id before setting on winner.
- `orders_pickup_address_id_fkey` — changed from DELETE addresses to UPDATE (move to winner), since orders already moved to winner still referenced those address IDs.
- `customers_stripe_customer_id_key` — must NULL loser's stripe_customer_id before setting on winner.

**Verification — all clean:**
- Zero orphaned references across all 10 FK tables (orders, sms_messages, email_messages, customer_transactions, notifications, subscriptions, cs_issues, addresses, customer_payment_methods, conversations).
- Only remaining phone duplicates are the 3 intentionally skipped groups.

**Potential cleanup (not done this session):**
- Duplicate addresses: some winners may now have two copies of the same address (theirs + loser's). Could deduplicate.
- Orphaned auth.users/profiles: losers whose profile_ids were NOT transferred still have orphan profile rows. Could clean up.

**No files changed — all work was SQL operations against Supabase.**

**Pending (carries forward):**
1. Re-enable `review_request` and `reorder_reminder` SMS templates when ready
2. Resolve 5 unpaid delivered orders ($567.75) — confirm if paid on Starchup side
3. Consider increasing Supabase OTP expiry for customers with slow entry
4. Cynthia Williams — likely landline, can't receive OTP. May need email login fallback
5. Credits not applied at charge time — only at Intake
6. Future refactor: replace inline onclick string interpolation with data attributes
7. Security hardening: escape customer data in attributes/onclick handlers
8. Deduplicate merged customer addresses (same address from both old accounts)
9. Clean up orphaned auth.users/profiles from deleted duplicate customers

---

### Mar 25, 2026 (session 65) — Root cause fix: auto-sync delivery stops on window change

**Root cause analysis — why wrong-date delivery stops kept recurring:**
- When an order is created, `auto_route_order()` trigger eagerly creates BOTH pickup and delivery stops on routes based on planned dates. This is correct at creation time.
- Problem: if `delivery_window_start` later changes (admin shifts window, customer reschedules), the delivery stop stays on the original route. There was NO mechanism to keep `route_stops` in sync with the order's delivery date.
- This caused recurring bugs where delivery stops appeared on the wrong day's route — every time a delivery window shifted post-creation, the stop became stale.

**Fix — new database trigger `trg_sync_delivery_stop_on_window_change`:**
- BEFORE UPDATE trigger on `orders` that fires when `delivery_window_start` changes.
- Compares the order's new delivery date (Pacific timezone) against the current route's `run_date`.
- If mismatched, automatically moves the pending delivery stop to the correct route using the same zone/template/day matching logic as `auto_route_order()`.
- Creates the target route if it doesn't exist yet (same as initial routing).
- Smart conflict avoidance: if admin is also setting `delivery_run_id` in the same update (explicit route reassignment), the trigger stands down and trusts the admin's choice.
- Clears stale `estimated_arrival` on moved stops so the optimizer recalculates.
- Updates `total_stops` counts on both old and new routes.
- Sets `moved_from_route_id` for audit trail.

**Also fixed — processing orders showing on route map:**
- Added `NOT_READY_FOR_DELIVERY` filter (`['processing', 'folding', 'picked_up']`) to hide delivery stops for orders not yet ready. Applied to card list, map, and chip badge counts in admin dashboard.

**Bug fixes from earlier in session:**
- Fixed `reoptimize_active_routes()` timezone bug: was using `CURRENT_DATE` (UTC) instead of `(now() AT TIME ZONE 'America/Los_Angeles')::date` — at 9:45 PM Pacific, this returned the next day, causing no routes to match.
- Fixed 4 misplaced delivery stops (orders with Mar 25 delivery windows on Mar 24 routes) — manually moved to correct routes.
- Lowered cron re-optimization threshold from 3 to 2 pending stops.
- Added auto-optimize-on-column-open in admin dashboard for routes missing ETAs.

**Bug: Christina Sullivan #472 pickup stop stuck in `en_route` while order was `picked_up`:**
- Root cause: order status was advanced but `trg_sync_stops_on_order_terminal` only syncs terminal statuses. Mid-pipeline statuses like `picked_up` didn't cascade to stops.
- Found 4 additional mismatched stops (#769, #765, #694, #310) — all `ready_for_delivery` with pickup stops still pending/en_route. Fixed all 5.
- **Structural fix — new trigger `trg_sync_stops_on_order_advance`:** AFTER UPDATE on orders, when status changes. If order advances past pickup phase → auto-completes pickup stop. If order reaches `delivered` → auto-completes delivery stop. Loop-safe with existing `sync_order_status_from_stops` (verified).

**New SQL objects:**
- Function: `sync_delivery_stop_on_window_change()` — auto-moves delivery stops when delivery_window_start changes
- Trigger: `trg_sync_delivery_stop_on_window_change` ON orders (BEFORE UPDATE)
- Function: `sync_stops_on_order_status_advance()` — auto-completes stops when order advances past their phase
- Trigger: `trg_sync_stops_on_order_advance` ON orders (AFTER UPDATE)

**Optimize button "Optimization failed" error:**
- Root cause: `optimizeRoute()` used `Promise.all` across all open route columns. Empty routes (0 stops) returned 400 from edge function, killing the entire batch.
- Fix 1: Edge function v15 — empty routes return 200 with `stops_optimized: 0` instead of 400.
- Fix 2: Admin dashboard `optimizeRoute()` rewritten with `Promise.allSettled`, pre-filters routes with no pending stops, shows per-route success/failure counts.

**QA blast radius fix — NOT_READY_FOR_DELIVERY filter:**
- Found 3 additional locations in Daily Schedule view that count stops for progress bars/popovers without the NOT_READY filter. These were inflating "pending" counts by including delivery stops for processing orders. All 3 fixed with `stop_type` added to queries.

**Files changed:** `admin-dashboard/index.html`, `supabase/functions/optimize-route/index.ts`

---

### Mar 25, 2026 (session 64) — Real-time dispatch optimizer: all 4 phases deployed

**Phase 1 — Time-window-aware optimization engine (optimize-route v14):**
- Deployed and verified. Edge function rewritten to group stops by time window (Window 1 first), combine pickup+delivery in single optimization pass, compute per-stop ETAs with 4-min service time, flag at-risk stops whose ETA exceeds their delivery/pickup window end.
- ETAs confirmed working: Berkeley AM (18 stops, 7:00→10:31 AM), Hayward AM (19 stops), Oakland AM (28 stops).
- Uses Google Directions API `optimize:true` with `departure_time=now` and `traffic_model=best_guess` for traffic-aware routing.

**Phase 2 — Driver app real-time stop order updates (driver-app/index.html):**
- Fixed `sortStopsByWindow()` to use `stop_number` as secondary sort within same-window stops (was being ignored, causing random order within windows).
- Added debounced re-sort (`debouncedResort()`) — when optimizer updates many stops at once, batches all Realtime events into a single UI update (300ms debounce).
- Updated Realtime UPDATE handler to detect `stop_number`/`estimated_arrival` changes and trigger debounced re-sort.
- Added ETA display on stop cards: pending stops show "ETA 7:42 AM" in accent color.
- Updated `reoptimizeRoute()` to fetch `estimated_arrival` alongside `stop_number`.

**Phase 3 — Periodic re-optimization via pg_cron:**
- Created `reoptimize_active_routes()` SQL function: finds routes for today with 3+ pending stops and a driver with GPS within 15 min, calls optimize-route edge function via pg_net with driver's current lat/lng.
- Scheduled as pg_cron job `reoptimize-active-routes` (jobid 12): runs every 5 minutes, 24/7. Self-gating — only fires HTTP calls when active routes exist.
- Manually tested: function found 4 qualifying routes and triggered all 4 optimizations successfully.

**Phase 4 — Admin dashboard ETA display + at-risk badges (admin-dashboard/index.html):**
- Stop cards now show ETA time for pending stops. At-risk stops (ETA past window end) show red "⚠ 8:42 PM" badge.
- Map pins turn red for at-risk stops. Pin popups show ETA and "LATE" warning.
- Added `estimated_arrival` to the RCC stop select query.

**Infrastructure changes:**
- New pg_cron job: `reoptimize-active-routes` (*/5 * * * *, jobid 12)
- New SQL function: `reoptimize_active_routes()`
- Edge function: `optimize-route` v14 (deployed, verified, production-active)

**Files changed:** `driver-app/index.html`, `admin-dashboard/index.html`, `supabase/functions/optimize-route/index.ts`

---

### Mar 24, 2026 (session 62) — UTC timezone fix, driver stop cascade fix, wrong-date stops corrected

**Critical bug fix — PM route stops landing on wrong day's route:**
- **Root cause:** Admin dashboard used `.split('T')[0]` and `.toISOString().slice(0,10)` to extract dates from UTC timestamps. For PM routes, 6 PM Pacific = `2026-03-25T01:00Z` → splitting gives `2026-03-25` (tomorrow) instead of `2026-03-24` (today). This caused delivery/pickup stops to be placed on the next day's route. Drivers wouldn't see stops for tonight's PM routes.
- **Fix (admin-dashboard/index.html):** Replaced 8 instances of UTC date extraction with `toLocalDate()` helper (which uses `toLocaleDateString('en-CA', { timeZone: BIZ_TZ })`):
  - `saveOrder()` pickup + delivery date fallbacks (lines 11103, 11110)
  - `selectNoSlot()` pickup date fallback (line 10727)
  - `selectNdSlot()` delivery date + day formatting fallbacks (lines 10960, 10962)
  - Reschedule modal prefill dates: pickup, delivery, delivery-min, auto-update (lines 6476–6496, 6799–6807)
  - `tomorrowStr` stat card helper (line 4888)
- **Fix (customer-app/index.html):** Replaced 2 instances of UTC date extraction in edit-schedule init (lines 4751–4752) with Pacific timezone conversion.
- **⚠️ RULE UPDATED:** Previous session 61 QA incorrectly assessed these `.toISOString().slice(0,10)` usages as "safe." They were NOT safe for PM routes. The standing rule now applies to ALL date extraction from UTC timestamps, not just "today" comparisons: **NEVER use `.split('T')[0]`, `.slice(0,10)`, or `.toISOString()` to extract dates from DB timestamps. Always use `toLocalDate()` (admin) or `toLocaleDateString('en-CA', { timeZone: 'America/Los_Angeles' })` (customer app).**

**Driver stop cascade fix (admin-dashboard/index.html):**
- **Problem:** `assignDriverOverride()` only cascaded stop `driver_id` changes to today's routes. Future routes relied solely on the DB trigger `trg_cascade_route_driver`, which could miss stops if the route record update was a no-op (driver_id unchanged → trigger skips).
- **Fix:** Now iterates ALL matching routes (today + future) and explicitly updates pending/en_route stops for each. Belt-and-suspenders — DB trigger is still the primary mechanism.
- **Symptom:** Robin Kline's delivery stop was assigned to Tulicia (old driver) on a route now driven by Aracely. Driver app filtered it out because `driver_id` didn't match.

**Data fixes (13 stops corrected):**
- **5 driver-mismatched stops:** Robin Kline, Gregg Loos (Oakland PM), Carrie Stone, Level Up Wellness (Oakland AM), and a future Gregg Loos (Mar 30) — stop `driver_id` updated to match route `driver_id`.
- **3 tonight stops on wrong-date routes:** Robin Kline, Eric Polk, Benjamin Olson — moved from Mar 25 route to tonight's Mar 24 route.
- **10 future stops on wrong-date routes (1 day to 1 week off):** Sahlee Tongson, Sarah Seiter, Janet Walker, Dani Black, Bruna Liborio, Brianna Headsten, jessica anderson — deleted misplaced stops, cleared order run_ids, re-routed via `auto_route_order()`. All landed on correct-date routes with zero routing errors.

**Verification:** Post-fix query confirmed zero mismatched stops remaining (stop window date ≠ route run_date) across all future routes.

**Files changed:** `admin-dashboard/index.html`, `customer-app/index.html`

**Pending (carries forward from session 61):**
1. Re-enable `review_request` and `reorder_reminder` SMS templates when ready
2. Resolve 5 unpaid delivered orders ($567.75) — confirm if paid on Starchup side
3. Consider increasing Supabase OTP expiry for customers with slow entry
4. Cynthia Williams — likely landline, can't receive OTP. May need email login fallback
5. Credits not applied at charge time — only at Intake
6. Future refactor: replace inline onclick string interpolation with data attributes
7. Security hardening: escape customer data in attributes/onclick handlers

### Mar 24, 2026 (session 59) — Cron jobs restored, unknown customers resolved, map click-to-customer, inbox fix

**pg_cron reminder jobs re-created:**
- `wr-reminder-evening` (8 PM PT) and `wr-reminder-morning` (7 AM PT) — both call `send-scheduled-reminders` edge function (v15) via `net.http_post()`.
- Preflight safety check confirmed no SMS blast risk — templates filtered to `pickup_reminder_recurring` and `pickup_day_reminder` only.
- Manually triggered morning job to cover today's pickups/deliveries since we were past the 7 AM window.

**Unknown customer names resolved (48 → 0):**
- Cross-referenced `first_name_cache`/`last_name_cache` = NULL customers against 3 Starchup migration CSVs by email and phone.
- Matched and updated 38 customers via SQL UPDATE on `profiles` table (names synced to `customers` cache columns).
- 2 additional matches found by David from Starchup screenshots (Melanie Peterson, Emilie Wong).
- 10 ghost accounts (phone/email-only signups, no orders, no addresses) deleted from `customers` and `profiles` tables.

**Click-to-customer-account from RCC (Orders) map (`admin-dashboard/index.html`):**
- Stop card customer names are now clickable → opens customer panel via `openCustomerPanel()`.
- Map pin popups show customer name as clickable link → same behavior.
- CSS hover state added: `.rcc-card-name[onclick]:hover` underlines with accent color.

**Click-to-customer-account from Customers map (`admin-dashboard/index.html`):**
- Marker click opens customer panel directly (replaced flyTo behavior).
- Info card (hover) also clickable with "View account →" link.
- Consistent with RCC map behavior.

**Z-index fix for panel overlays (`admin-dashboard/index.html`):**
- Leaflet maps use z-index up to ~1000 internally. Side panel (1100), backdrop (1099), and order panel (1101) bumped above map layers.

**Inbox reply lag fix (`admin-dashboard/index.html`):**
- Sent messages now appear instantly via optimistic UI update — appends bubble to DOM immediately after successful send.
- Replaced full `openSMSConversation()` reload (which had a race condition with the edge function DB write) with local DOM append + `loadInbox()` for sidebar refresh.

**Commits:**
- `abe0949` — Add click-to-customer-account from RCC map view
- `63a354f` — Add click-to-customer-account from Customer map pins
- `b32f71d` — Fix panel z-index to appear above Leaflet map layers
- `9c9796d` — Fix inbox reply lag — optimistically append sent message to thread

**Pending (carries forward):**
1. Re-enable `review_request` and `reorder_reminder` SMS templates when ready
2. Resolve 5 unpaid delivered orders ($567.75) — confirm if paid on Starchup side
3. QA + security review (deferred from session 57)

### Mar 23, 2026 (session 58) — Launch blast complete + unpaid order audit

**Launch blast — COMPLETE for all active customers:**
- Sent batches 10–15 (final 6 batches) to remaining ~591 unreached active customers.
- **Final campaign totals:** 1,527 unique emails, 1,404 unique SMS across 15 batches (sessions 51–58).
- All active customers (ordered within past year, excluding retail + commercial) have now been reached.
- $20 credit deadline: "Tuesday at midnight" (unchanged from session 56).
- 220 active customers opted out of SMS — received email only.

**Campaign conversion snapshot (as of end of session 58):**
- 358 unique logins since launch (23% of active pool)
- 231 active customers with Stripe card on file
- 290 customers with credits > 0 ($8,203.80 total outstanding)
- 225 customers with exactly $20 (unused promo credit)
- SMS opt-out rate: ~1.4% from campaign

**Unpaid delivered orders — 5 orders, $567.75:**
- Orders #153, #161, #228, #231, #309 were delivered without payment processed.
- All were Starchup migration orders already in progress when backfilled — they bypassed the normal charge trigger.
- All 4 real customers (Ruby Anderson, Jennifer Stahl, Klaire Hubbard, Linda Malbreau) have Stripe customer IDs now. Order #153 is David's test.
- Decision pending: charge retroactively or write off as transition cost (likely already billed on Starchup side).

**Pending (carries forward):**
1. ~~Re-create cron jobs~~ — ✅ Done in session 59
2. Re-enable `review_request` and `reorder_reminder` SMS templates when ready
3. Resolve 5 unpaid delivered orders ($567.75) — confirm if paid on Starchup side
4. QA + security review (deferred from session 57)

### Mar 23, 2026 (session 57) — Kanban long-press, pickup/delivery details, driver duplicate fix

**Kanban touch refactor — long-press to drag (`admin-dashboard/index.html`):**
- Replaced instant finger-drag with 500ms long-press-to-drag on processing queue cards.
- Normal iPad scrolling now works because `touch-action: auto` is the default; `preventDefault` only fires after long-press confirmed.
- New state: `_tdLongPressTimer`, `_tdLongPressReady`, `_cancelLongPress()` helper.
- Visual feedback: `.long-press-active` CSS class scales card to 1.04× with accent border.
- 10px movement threshold cancels long-press (prevents accidental drags while scrolling).
- Removed `draggable="true"`, `ondragstart`, `ondragend` from Clean and Fold card templates.

**Pickup/delivery details on processing queue (`admin-dashboard/index.html`):**
- New shared helper `_buildPickupDeliveryHTML(o)` renders address, date/slot, and route name for both pickup and delivery on each order card.
- All 4 queue loaders (Intake, Clean, Fold, Rack) + Intake fresh-fetch updated to include `pickup_window_start/end`, `delivery_window_start/end`, `pickup_address_id`, `delivery_address_id`, `customers(..., addresses(...))`, `pickup_run(id, name)`, `delivery_run(id, name)`.
- TODAY/OVERDUE highlighting on dates. XSS-safe via `esc()` wrapper on all user-sourced strings.
- Commit: `b5b0e16`

**Driver app duplicate fix (`driver-app/index.html`):**
- **Root cause:** `.single()` on `drivers` table crashed when Aracely had 20 duplicate records → `drv0 = null` → auto-create fired → more duplicates each refresh → "No Stops Today".
- **Fix:** Changed `.single()` to `.order('created_at').limit(1).maybeSingle()`. Added double-check query before auto-creating a driver record.
- Deleted 19 duplicate driver records for Aracely, keeping the original.
- Commit: `be7d5bb`

**XSS escape fix:** `_buildPickupDeliveryHTML()` wraps address and route strings with `esc()` before HTML injection.

**SMS rate limit:** Identified Supabase Auth rate limit at 30 SMS/hr causing customer login errors. David increased to 100/hr in dashboard settings.

---

### Mar 23, 2026 (session 56) — Launch blasts 4–9, inbox filtering, SMS opt-out badge, skip behavior fix

**Launch campaign — batches 4–9 (600 customers reached this session):**
- Same email template ("We've upgraded your experience") and SMS ("Our new ordering app is live!") as previous blasts.
- $20 credit deadline changed from "Monday midnight" to **"Tuesday midnight"** starting batch 1 of this session.
- Audience: active customers (ordered within past year), excluding retail (2609 Foothill), commercial (billing_type = 'on_account'), and already-reached customers.
- Sent via `net.http_post()` calling `send-email` and `send-sms` edge functions. Batches of 100 every ~10 minutes.
- SMS skipped for customers with `sms_consent_at IS NULL` — they received email only.
- **Session totals:** 600 emails + ~538 SMS sent across 6 batches.
- **All-time campaign totals:** 948 unique emails, 885 unique SMS across all blasts (sessions 51–56).
- **Remaining:** ~591 customers still to reach.
- **Campaign conversion snapshot:** 143 customers with card on file (17%), 195 logged in (23%), 139 received $20 credit confirmation. 11 new STOP replies (1.4% opt-out rate), 65 real customer replies.

**Inbox — hide outbound-only conversations (`admin-dashboard/index.html`):**
- Added `hasInbound` flag to conversation builder in `loadInbox()`. Conversations now only appear in the Inbox when the customer has sent at least one inbound message.
- Prevents launch blast SMS from flooding the Inbox with hundreds of one-way threads.
- Compose button still works — you can send to anyone, conversation just won't show until they reply.
- Commit: `8249786`

**Inbox — SMS opted-out badge (`admin-dashboard/index.html`):**
- Added `sms_consent_at` to the customers join in `loadInbox()` SELECT.
- Conversation list: red "SMS opted out" label next to the SMS badge for opted-out customers.
- Thread header: red "⚠ Opted out of SMS — texts won't be delivered" warning under phone number.
- Helps David know when to email or call instead of texting.

**Skip behavior fix — driver and admin skips now generate recurring orders:**
- **Root cause:** Driver app `skipStop()` set `cancelled_by = 'driver'`, and admin status changes set `cancelled_by = 'admin'` for skips. The `trg_create_recurring_order` trigger only fires when `cancelled_by = 'customer'`, so driver/admin skips broke the recurring chain and cluttered the Issues tab.
- **Fix:** Driver app `skipStop()` now sets `cancelled_by = 'customer'`. Admin dashboard `opSetOrderStatus()` and `setSingleOrderStatus()` set `cancelled_by = 'customer'` for skips (still `'admin'` for cancels/failures).
- **Data fix:** 6 orders skipped today (Ellen Konnert, Alicia Swartz, Paula Spiese, Satina Dunigan, Julia Donaldson, Karim Biaye) had `cancelled_by` corrected to `'customer'`. 5 missing next recurring orders were generated by temporarily resetting status to trigger `trg_create_recurring_order` (Julia Donaldson already had hers).
- **Design principle updated:** A skip is always routine regardless of who initiates it. Only cancels and failures are real issues.

**Pending (resolved in sessions 57–58):**
1. ~~591 customers still need launch blast~~ — ✅ Completed session 58 (all active customers reached)
2. ~~git push needed~~ — ✅ Pushed session 57
3. Re-create `wr-reminder-evening` and `wr-reminder-morning` cron jobs (still removed since session 41)
4. Re-enable `review_request` and `reorder_reminder` SMS templates when ready

---

### Mar 23, 2026 (session 55) — Launch blast #3 (216 customers) + Kanban UX + driver undo removal

**Launch blast #3 — email + SMS to 216 remaining customers with orders:**
- Same email template ("We've upgraded your experience") and SMS ("Our new ordering app is live!") as blasts #1 and #2.
- Same $20 credit deadline: "Update by Monday at midnight."
- Audience: all customers with at least one order who were NOT reached by blast #1 (82) or #2 (49), excluding retail (address_cache ILIKE '%2609 Foothill%') and commercial (billing_type = 'on_account').
- **Blast #3 results:** 216 emails sent, 215 SMS sent (1 customer missing phone number).
- **All-time totals across 3 blasts:** 348 unique customers emailed, 347 unique customers texted.
- Preflight safety check passed: 0 enabled message templates, 0 message-sending triggers on email/sms tables, 0 message-sending cron jobs.
- Note: initial SMS run caught only ~0 new recipients because the `already_reached` CTE unioned email_messages (which now included the just-sent blast #3 emails). Fixed by targeting blast #3 email recipients who hadn't yet received an SMS.

**Kanban (Processing Queue) UX improvements — `admin-dashboard/index.html`:**
- **Intake column cards no longer draggable.** iPad users in a full column were accidentally moving cards when trying to scroll. Cards now use `onclick` (click-to-open) instead of drag. CSS class `no-drag` disables drag affordances.
- **All 4 columns now searchable.** Added `<input class="kanban-search">` to Intake, Clean, Fold, and Rack columns. `filterKanbanCol()` function filters cards by text content. Search re-applied after each render cycle so it persists through data refreshes.
- Kanban card template for Intake changed from `draggable="true"` to `class="proc-card no-drag"` with `onclick` handler.

**Driver app — undo bar removed for completed stops — `driver-app/index.html`:**
- Removed the 12-second undo bar that appeared after a driver completed a pickup or delivery. Drivers were instinctively tapping the undo bar, reversing completed stops.
- The "skip" undo bar was kept intact — different use case, less prone to accidental taps.
- Change: lines ~2747-2754 replaced `showUndoBar(...)` call with a comment explaining the removal.

**Folding column now shows delivery zone — `admin-dashboard/index.html`:**
- Each card in the Folding column displays a color-coded zone badge (e.g. "📍 Oakland", "📍 Alameda") so the folder knows where to rack each order.
- `loadFolding()` query updated to join `service_zones(name, color)` via `zone_id`.
- Badge uses the zone's map color for dot + tinted background, with dark text for readability (avoids yellow/green text contrast issues).

**Commits:**
- `b86a515` — fix: disable Intake drag + add Kanban search + remove driver undo bar
- `52f0de6` — docs: session 55 — launch blast #3 to 216 customers
- `4796bae` — feat: show delivery zone on Folding kanban cards

### Mar 22, 2026 (session 54) — Customer profile enrichment from Starchup

**Scope:** Matched WashRoute customers (who have at least one order) against the Starchup customer database by email, then backfilled historical stats and washing preferences.

**53 customers matched and updated with Starchup stats:**
- `total_orders` — historical order count from Starchup
- `lifetime_value` — total spend from Starchup
- `default_tip` + `default_tip_type` — for 14 customers who had a tip preference set (all percentage-based: 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 50%)
- `credits` — for 3 customers who had Starchup credit balances ($20, $50, $70)

**27 customers updated with washing preferences from Starchup:**
- Fetched per-customer cleaning preferences via Starchup API (`/api/Customers/{id}/cleaning_preferences`)
- Filtered to Family Laundry facility (ID 231) preferences only
- Mapped Starchup preference IDs to WashRoute preference UUIDs + option IDs:
  - SC 2569 "Add Oxi?" → WR Oxi preference
  - SC 2581 "Air Dry Delicates" → WR Air Dry preference
  - SC 2582 "Double wash" → WR Double Wash preference
  - SC 2616 "Vinegar Boost" → WR Vinegar preference
  - SC 2618 "Shirt Service" → WR Shirt Service preference
- Starchup values like `"Yes ($3/bag)"` mapped to WR Yes option IDs; `"No"` mapped to WR No option IDs
- Most common add-on: Oxi (25 of 27 customers). Vinegar second (8). Double Wash (2). Air Dry (2).

**Cynthia GerleinSafdi bug fix:**
- WashRoute showed `lifetime_value = $4,292,022.00` with `total_orders = 0` — clearly a migration artifact
- Starchup confirmed: 3 orders, $273.85 total
- Fixed to correct values

**Multiple addresses identified (reference only — not stored in customers table):**
- 10 customers had 2+ addresses in Starchup; most were duplicates
- Genuinely different addresses: Rabun Jones (2), Mark Heslop (3), Patti Birbiglia (2), Quinlan Heathers (3), Sarah Buster (3)
- WashRoute stores addresses on route_stops, not as a customer multi-address field

**Matching stats:**
- 357 WR customers with orders → matched against 2,700 Starchup customers by email
- 53 matches (15%) — remaining 304 are either newer WR-only customers or have different emails between systems

**Technical notes:**
- `default_tip_type` check constraint uses `'$'` and `'%'` (not `'percent'`/`'flat'`)
- Starchup cleaning preference values include price suffix (e.g., `"Yes ($3/bag)"`) — match on `startsWith('Yes')` not exact equality
- Preflight safety check confirmed: no triggers on `customers` table, no enabled SMS templates, cron jobs don't interact with stats columns

---

### Mar 22, 2026 (session 53) — Full Starchup backfill: 248 orders, 19 new customers, zone matching

**Scope:** Backfilled ALL remaining Starchup orders after 3/23/2026 from the Orders > Delivery page into WashRoute. Excluded only routes named "COMMERCIAL 1" and "KIDANGO" on Starchup, plus 10 Kidango daycare locations outside all service zones (San Jose, Union City, Newark).

**19 new customers created in WashRoute:**
- Full profiles migrated from Starchup: addresses with lat/lng, delivery instructions, default tips, credits, order counts, lifetime spend.
- Tagged with `referral_source = 'starchup_migration'` for tracking.
- Customer matching used 3-tier strategy (email → name → phone) — reduced initial 133 "missing" to 19 truly new.

**Zone matching — client-side ray-casting + city name fallback:**
- Downloaded all 6 zone polygons as GeoJSON from `service_zones.polygon` via `ST_AsGeoJSON()`.
- Implemented ray-casting point-in-polygon algorithm in browser JS (`window._wrFindZone`).
- **⚠️ CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** The PostGIS `polygon` column is only a rough hand-drawn supplement (e.g., Berkeley has just 15 coordinate points across 2 rings). The actual zone boundaries rendered on the admin dashboard map come from `city_polygons` (jsonb column) — detailed city boundary GeoJSON with hundreds of points per city, sourced from Nominatim/OSM. Zone matching in WashRoute uses BOTH sources (see "Zone Matching Architecture" below).
- Because the ray-casting used only the PostGIS `polygon` column, many customers appeared "outside" their zone when they were clearly inside on the dashboard map (e.g., Anubhav Arora in central Berkeley).
- City-name fallback assignments corrected all mismatches — all 248 orders have correct `zone_id`.
- Additional force-assignments by city: Orinda → Concord, Castro Valley/Fremont → Oakland/Hayward, north Oakland edge → Oakland.
- 10 Kidango daycares in San Jose/Union City/Newark excluded (outside all zones).

**248 orders inserted with auto-routing:**
- Created `bulk_insert_orders(json)` SQL function (SECURITY DEFINER) to bypass RLS, called from browser via Supabase RPC in 13 batches of 20.
- Each INSERT triggered `auto_route_on_insert` → `auto_route_order()` which created route runs and route_stops automatically.
- **Result: 248/248 routed (pickup + delivery), 0 routing errors, 0 null service_id, 0 SMS sent.**
- Function dropped after use.

**Route breakdown:**
| Route | Orders |
|---|---|
| Oakland AM | 65 |
| Oakland PM | 45 |
| Berkeley PM | 29 |
| Hayward AM | 28 |
| SF PM | 26 |
| Berkeley AM | 18 |
| Alameda PM | 17 |
| Hayward PM | 14 |
| Alameda AM | 5 |
| Concord AM | 1 |

**Recurring breakdown:** 163 weekly, 50 biweekly, 22 monthly, 9 one-time. Pickup dates: 3/24–4/29/2026.

**Outside-polygon customer list:** Spreadsheet saved to `WashRoute/outside-polygon-customers.xlsx` — 31 customers whose addresses fall outside current zone polygon geometry (13 Berkeley gap, 3 west Berkeley, 4 south Hayward, 3 Oakland edge, 1 Orinda, 10 Kidango excluded). Orders were still created for all except the 10 Kidango locations.

**Customer stats updated:** `total_orders` incremented and `last_order_at` set for all 234 customers who received backfilled orders.

**Preflight safety check passed:** 0 enabled SMS/email templates, no message-sending triggers on orders/route_stops, 3 active cron jobs (none send messages). SMS baseline: 418 messages before, 418 after (3 unrelated credit notifications during session). Risk level: LOW.

**Known issue — outside-polygon spreadsheet is inaccurate:**
- The spreadsheet `outside-polygon-customers.xlsx` was generated using only the PostGIS `polygon` column, which is a rough hand-drawn shape. Many customers listed as "outside" are actually inside their zones when checked against the full zone definition (`city_polygons` + `cities` array + `polygon`). The spreadsheet is mostly noise and should be regenerated if needed.

**Zone Matching Architecture (CRITICAL — for all future sessions):**
The `service_zones` table has THREE zone-defining columns that work together:
1. **`cities`** (text array) — e.g., `['Berkeley', 'El Cerrito', 'Albany', 'kensington']`. The admin UI says: "Any order whose address city matches will be placed in this zone — no polygon needed." This is the simplest matching layer.
2. **`city_polygons`** (jsonb) — Array of objects, each with `name` and `geojson` (detailed Polygon with hundreds of coordinate points from actual city boundaries via Nominatim/OSM). This is what the dashboard map renders as **dashed-line city boundaries**. Example: Berkeley zone has 4 entries (Berkeley, El Cerrito, Albany, Kensington) each with precise GeoJSON.
3. **`polygon`** (PostGIS geometry, USER-DEFINED) — Hand-drawn polygon with few points (e.g., Berkeley has only 15 points across 2 geometries). This is what the dashboard renders as the **solid-line drawn polygon**. It extends zone coverage beyond city boundaries into unincorporated areas.

**Correct zone matching must use ALL THREE:** city name match from `cities` array, point-in-polygon against `city_polygons[].geojson`, AND point-in-polygon against PostGIS `polygon`. A customer is "in zone" if ANY of the three matches.

**Zone IDs for reference:** Alameda=`9d624c91`, Berkeley=`2dfc9835`, Concord=`ebc59b58`, Hayward=`39d9a0c0`, Oakland=`fbc4627b`, SF=`1f7ab563`

### Mar 22, 2026 (session 52) — Launch blast #2 (49 customers) + service_id fix

**Launch blast #2 — email + SMS to 49 customers with upcoming scheduled orders:**
- Targeted customers who have orders with `pickup_window_start >= '2026-03-23'` and `status = 'scheduled'` but were NOT in the first blast (84 customers reached in blast #1).
- Same email subject: `The new Family Laundry app is live - log in for $20 Credit`
- Same SMS body: personalized "Hi {first_name}, Family Laundry here. Our new ordering app is live!..." with app link and $20 credit deadline.
- **Total customers now reached: 132** (83 email + 49 email = 132 emails; 84 SMS + 50 SMS = 134 SMS — slight overlap due to 2 extra customers in SMS batch).

**How the blast works (reference for future blasts):**
1. Identify unreached customers via CTE that unions `email_messages` (by subject match) and `sms_messages` (by date range + direction).
2. Email: `DO $$ ... FOR r IN (SELECT ...) LOOP ... PERFORM net.http_post(url := 'https://umjpbuxrdydwejqtensq.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-email', ..., body := jsonb_build_object('to_email', r.email_cache, 'subject', '...', 'body', email_html, 'customer_id', r.id)) ... END LOOP; END $$;`
3. SMS: Same pattern but calls `/functions/v1/send-sms` with `jsonb_build_object('to', r.phone_cache, 'body', sms_text, 'customer_id', r.id)`.
4. Both edge functions log to `email_messages` / `sms_messages` tables automatically.
5. **Critical param names:** `send-email` expects `to_email`, `subject`, `body`. `send-sms` expects `to`, `body`, `customer_id`. (First attempt used wrong param `to` instead of `to_email` for email — got 400 errors; fixed on retry.)
6. Auth: `Authorization: Bearer` + `current_setting('app.settings.service_role_key', true)` — the service role key is available inside pg_net DO blocks via this Postgres setting.

**Email HTML template (inline, no external file):**
- Heading: "We've upgraded your experience"
- Personalized greeting: "Hi {first_name},"
- Body: app intro, "Your account is ready", numbered steps (log in, update details)
- Green callout box: "$20 credit if you update by Monday at midnight"
- Purple CTA button: "Open the App →" linking to `app.familylaundry.com`
- Footer: "Questions? Reply to this email" + "The Family Laundry Team"
- Inline CSS, max-width 520px, Apple system font stack

**SMS template:**
```
Hi {first_name}, Family Laundry here. Our new ordering app is live! Log in now to update your preferences and payment details: app.familylaundry.com

Update by Monday midnight and get $20 in laundry credit, automatically added to your account.
```

**Preflight safety check passed:** 0 enabled SMS templates, 0 message-sending triggers on email/sms tables, 0 cron jobs that send messages. Risk level: LOW.

**Bug fix — missing `service_id` on backfilled orders:**
- All 6 processing orders (#309–314) and 34 of the 44 PM pickup orders (#264–308) had `service_id = NULL` from the backfill INSERT.
- Without `service_id`, the admin Details tab couldn't look up the Wash & Fold price ($59/bag) — showed only the delivery fee ($9.95).
- Fixed: `UPDATE orders SET service_id = 'd97ba33a-...' WHERE order_number BETWEEN 264 AND 314 AND service_id IS NULL` — set all 40 to Wash & Fold Delivery service.
- Also recalculated Order #310 (Suzanne Stroebe) line_items: 1 bag × $59 + $9.95 delivery = $68.95 total. Other processing orders will calculate correctly when edited in the admin UI since `service_id` is now set.
- **Lesson for future backfills:** Always include `service_id` in the INSERT. The Wash & Fold Delivery service ID is `d97ba33a-4fb1-43e4-8bfa-29cd68b95fcb`.

**Standing instruction:** When checking or modifying customer data, update `total_orders` and `lifetime_value` stats.

**Next steps for tomorrow:**
- Continue email + SMS blasts to wider audience. Eligible pool after exclusions: **4,722 customers** (4,647 with email).
- **Exclusion rules:** Always filter out (1) retail customers: `address_cache ILIKE '%2609 Foothill%'` (382 people — walk-in/drop-off at the processing center), and (2) commercial customers: `billing_type = 'on_account'` (49 people — billed separately, not self-service app users). 2 overlap both.
- Use the same DO $$ / pg_net method documented above.
- Consider updating the $20 credit deadline wording if Monday has passed.
- David may want to batch the 4,722 into tiers (e.g., most active first) rather than blasting all at once.

### Mar 22, 2026 (session 51) — Launch blast to 82 customers + full PM backfill (44 orders)

**Launch blast — emails + SMS sent to all 82 existing customers:**
- Message 1 (email): Branded launch email with "We've upgraded your experience" messaging, $20 credit callout, CTA to `app.familylaundry.com`. Template saved to `launch-email-template.html`.
- Message 2 (SMS): Concise launch text with app link and $20 promo mention.
- Test sends to David and Laura Guevara confirmed working before bulk send.
- Bulk send used `net.http_post()` via pg_net (VM proxy blocks direct curl to Supabase edge functions — 403 from allowlist). FOR loops in DO $$ blocks iterated all 82 customers.
- Confirmed 3 customers (Benjamin Olson, Chezka Solon, Emily Budeke) had already logged in and triggered the $20 promo credit flow by the time the blast completed.

**Monday 3/23 PM Pickups — 44 non-commercial PM orders backfilled (orders #264–308):**

First pass (11 orders created manually, some with routing corrections):
- San Francisco: 4 orders — ISHITA SAINI, Karen White*, Melissa Crouch, Dominic Volpatti*
- Oakland PM: 3 orders — Meriem Bekka, Tim Johnson ×2
- Hayward PM: 2 orders — Dallas Butler, Noel Thomas
- Berkeley PM: 1 order — Bronwyn Ayla
- (*) = new customer created this session
- Ruby Anderson order was created in error (her weekly doesn't start until 3/30) — deleted.

Second pass (33 orders bulk-inserted from Starchup-filtered page):
- Data extracted from Starchup Orders > Pickups page filtered to 3/23/2026 (David confirmed 48 PM pickups total = 44 residential + 4 commercial; commercial ignored).
- Each customer mapped to WashRoute zone and route template pickup windows.
- `auto_route_on_insert` trigger auto-routed all 33 — zero routing errors.
- Preflight safety check confirmed: 0 SMS templates enabled, 0 message-sending triggers, 0 message-sending cron jobs. No unintended messages sent.

**Final PM route counts for Monday 3/23:**

| Route | Orders | Recurring breakdown |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| San Francisco | 11 | 7 weekly, 1 biweekly, 3 one-time |
| Hayward PM | 9 | 6 weekly, 3 one-time |
| Oakland PM | 9 | 5 weekly, 4 one-time |
| Alameda PM | 9 | 5 weekly, 4 biweekly |
| Berkeley PM | 8 | 6 weekly, 1 biweekly, 1 one-time |
| **Total** | **46** | (44 from Starchup + Chezka Solon + Harriett Feltman pre-existing) |

**New customers created this session (5 total):**
- Karen White — k109036@msn.com, (415) 664-7942, 1270 44th Ave, San Francisco 94122
- Dominic Volpatti — dvdrummer360@gmail.com, (916) 715-6617, 137 Garfield St, San Francisco 94132
- Paula Murphy — paularuthmurphy@gmail.com, (510) 227-9773, 4866 Trinidad Ave, Oakland 94602 → Hayward zone
- Jennifer Evans — jenjackson24@gmail.com, (415) 279-8260, 1504 Verdi St, Alameda 94501 → Alameda zone
- Dennison Williams — (address from Starchup), 2800 Bryant St, San Francisco 94110 → SF zone

**Address updates:**
- Bronwyn Ayla: added "2000 Prince Street, Berkeley 94703" as second address (Starchup order address differs from existing "3326 Dwight Way, Berkeley 94704" in WashRoute)

**Routing corrections (first pass):**
- Dallas Butler: `auto_route_order` placed him on Hayward AM because his 18:00 PT pickup fell outside Hayward PM's 19:00-22:00 window. Manually moved to Hayward PM.
- Noel Thomas: Initially assigned to Oakland zone based on city name. David corrected — per WashRoute's zone map, 94619 (deep East Oakland / Seminary area) falls within the **Hayward zone**, not Oakland. Moved to Hayward PM.
- Ruby Anderson: Order created for 3/23 in error — her recurring weekly doesn't start until 3/30 (WashRoute already had auto-generated order #162 for that date). Order deleted.

**Routing lesson for second pass:** Set pickup windows to match WashRoute route template windows exactly (not Starchup pickup times). SF/Hayward = 7-10 PM (02:00-05:00 UTC). Oakland/Berkeley/Alameda 6-8 PM = 01:00-03:00 UTC, 8-10 PM = 03:00-05:00 UTC. This avoided the Dallas Butler misroute problem entirely.

**⚠️ Critical zone mapping rules (reinforced this session):**
1. Oakland zone ≠ Oakland city. The Oakland zone covers roughly Piedmont, Temescal, Rockridge, and central Oakland (yellow on zone map). Deep East Oakland (94619, 94621) and South Oakland fall in the **Hayward zone** (red on map).
2. Never assign zones by city name alone — always check the zone map or match against existing customers in the same zip code.
3. The `auto_route_order` function routes by time window match within a zone. If a pickup time falls outside all PM windows (e.g., 18:00 PT vs 19:00 PM start), it may fall back to AM routes. Always verify PM orders land on PM routes after auto-routing.

**6 in-processing orders with PM deliveries on 3/23 (orders #309–314):**
- These were older orders picked up 3/20–3/21, currently in processing, needing delivery stops on Monday PM routes.
- Created with `status = 'processing'`, past pickup windows (for records), and 3/23 PM delivery windows.
- `auto_route_on_insert` trigger does NOT fire for non-'scheduled' status — all 6 required manual `SELECT auto_route_order(id)` calls.
- Dennison Williams was a new customer (created this session — 5th new customer total).

| # | Customer | Route | Recurring |
|---|----------|-------|-----------|
| 309 | Linda Malbreau | Oakland PM | one-time |
| 310 | Suzanne Stroebe | Berkeley PM | weekly |
| 311 | Jennifer Lamphere | San Francisco PM | biweekly |
| 312 | Patricia Hedl | Hayward PM | biweekly |
| 313 | Gigi Gamble | Alameda PM | one-time |
| 314 | Dennison Williams | San Francisco PM | one-time |

**New customers created this session (5 total):** added Dennison Williams — 2800 Bryant St, San Francisco 94110 → SF zone.

**Monday 3/23 grand totals:** 58 AM pickups + 46 PM pickups + 6 PM deliveries (in-processing) = 110 route stops on Monday alone, plus deliveries across Tue-Thu.

### Mar 22, 2026 (session 50) — Starchup backfill: Monday AM pickups, deliveries, recurring schedules, commercial accounts

**Monday 3/23 AM Pickups — 58 orders created (orders #187–244):**
- Hayward AM: 21 orders | BERK AM: 17 orders | Oakland AM: 14 orders | Alameda AM: 6 orders
- 11 same-day turnaround orders (AM pickup → PM delivery same day) identified from Starchup order details and created with `is_same_day = true`
- Same-day customers: Ruth Cossey, Monica Arnold, Onimisi Ojeba, Cory Johnson, Norah Nicholls (Hayward); Jennifer Stahl, Klaire Hubbard, Jennifer Leech, Erinn Nahid (Berkeley); Julia Donaldson, Andrea Dooley (Oakland)

**Recurring order schedules set via `recurring_interval` column:**
- 34 weekly, 4 biweekly (Satina Dunigan ×2, Alicia Swartz, Amanda Piasecki, Karim Biaye), 1 monthly (Jonathan Rodriguez), 1 biweekly delivery (Gwen BellBabaoye)
- Recurring engine verified working: `create_recurring_order_on_delivered` trigger reads `recurring_interval` ('weekly'/'biweekly'/'monthly') and auto-creates the next order when current one is delivered or customer-skipped. Skips Sundays by bumping to Monday.
- **⚠️ Lesson learned:** Initial batch backfill only set `source = 'recurring'` (a label) but missed the `recurring_interval` column (the field the trigger actually checks). Future backfills MUST check Starchup's Orders page for the recurring icon on each order and hover/click for cadence info before creating in WashRoute.

**Deliveries — 13 orders (#174–186) from prior session confirmed:**
- 3 set to weekly recurring (Matt Yan #174, Hoan TonThat #176, Brooke Rosenberg #180)
- 1 set to biweekly (Gwen BellBabaoye #186)

**Commercial accounts — 4 verified and updated for April 1 transition:**
- Charlotte Maxwell Clinic: already in WashRoute, added address (411 30th St #508, Oakland 94609), set `account_type = 'commercial'`, pickup order #244 created
- Fitnesse Training Club: already in WashRoute, set `account_type = 'commercial'`, added 2nd address (2 Ambler Lane, Oakland 94608), pickup order #230 created
- Nit Pixies: created in WashRoute (oakland@nitpixies.com), 2 addresses (5009 Woodminster Ln Oakland, 11362 San Pablo Ave El Cerrito), pickup order #229 created (BERK AM, weekly)
- Reup Refill Shop: created in WashRoute (order@wastewhat.org), address (6076 Claremont Ave Oakland), pickup order #239 created (BERK AM, weekly)

**New customers created (from Starchup lookup):**
- Erika VanHarken, Mark Heslop, Patti Birbigli (session 49 continuation)
- Multiple missing customers discovered during screenshot verification: Jennifer Stahl, Ruth Cossey, Julia Donaldson, Klaire Hubbard, Monica Arnold, Erinn Nahid, Bridget Guerra, Yvette Beavers, Jennifer Leech, Onimisi Ojeba, Marilyn Waller, Saied Amiry, Cory Johnson, Norah Nicholls, Andrea Dooley

**⚠️ Process note for future Starchup backfills:**
1. Use Starchup's **Orders page** (not just route pages) — it shows recurring icons and same-day delivery info
2. Check each order for the **recurring icon** (circular arrows) and hover for cadence (weekly/biweekly/monthly)
3. Check if **delivery date = pickup date** → set `is_same_day = true` and use PM route delivery windows
4. Set `recurring_interval` on the order at creation time so the trigger works automatically after delivery
5. The `source = 'recurring'` field is just a label — the trigger only checks `recurring_interval`
6. **Always geocode after creating addresses via SQL.** Addresses inserted directly into the DB won't have lat/lng coordinates, so they won't appear on the route map. Run `geocodeMissing()` from the admin dashboard browser console after any batch address insert. The customer app and admin dashboard both auto-geocode via Google Maps when addresses are added through the UI, so this only applies to direct SQL inserts.

**Geocoding fix:** 11 addresses created via SQL during this session were missing lat/lng. Ran `geocodeMissing()` from admin dashboard — all 11 now geocoded.

**Monday morning totals: 71 stops** (58 pickups + 13 deliveries), plus 11 same-day PM deliveries in the evening.

### Mar 22, 2026 (session 49) — Starchup backfill: 8 picked-up orders migrated, customer data reconciled

- **Backfilled 8 picked-up orders from final Starchup pickup night (3/21/26):** Ruby Anderson (#161), Caragh England (#163), Naomi Odean (#167), Sal Dazzo (#168), Matt Holmes (#169), Devki Patel (#170), Steve Wilson (#171), B Curry (#172). Each order: inserted as `scheduled` (triggers auto-routing), then updated to `picked_up` with actual pickup timestamp and bag count. Pickup route_stops marked `complete`.
- **Customer data reconciled against Starchup for each customer:** Updated stats (total_orders, lifetime_value, credits), default tips, wash & fold preferences (oxi, vinegar, air dry, double wash, shirt service), delivery instructions, and phone numbers where they differed.
- **Address fix — Naomi Odean:** Added missing 59 Parkside Drive address (was only 43 Slater Lane in DB). Set as default per Starchup. Both addresses retained.
- **All SMS and email templates remain disabled** (turned off session 49 start for safe backfill — no automated messages sent to customers during inserts).
- **Delivery window rule established:** Delivery windows on orders must always match the route template's `arrival_window_hours`. SF and Hayward = 3-hour full window (7–10 PM). Berkeley, Alameda, Oakland = 2-hour sub-windows (6–8 PM or 8–10 PM). Fixed B Curry's delivery window from incorrect 8–10 PM to correct 7–10 PM (SF route).
- **`recurring_interval` rule clarified:** One-time orders use `NULL` (not `'one_time'`). Setting `'one_time'` causes the UI to render a recurring icon with tooltip "Every one_time". Fixed on Naomi's order.
- **Tips not yet functional at processing intake.** `calcProcTotal()` and `_buildIntakeLineItems()` do not include `tip_amount`. Customer app has zero tip UI. **Must be fixed before launch blast invitations.** David flagged as today's priority.
- **Pending — tips end-to-end fix (PRIORITY — before launch blasts):**
  1. `calcProcTotal()` must include `tip_amount` from the order
  2. `_buildIntakeLineItems()` should create a tip line item
  3. Verify `charge-order` charges the full amount including tip
  4. Add default tip setting to customer app
  5. Remind David about tips before sending launch announcement blasts

### Mar 21, 2026 (session 48) — Sunday launch prep: $20 promo, launch emails/SMS, account reset, QA

- **$20 signup promo credit system (launch promo):** Postgres trigger `trg_signup_promo_credit` on `customer_payment_methods` INSERT. When a customer adds their **first** payment card before Monday March 23 midnight PT, the trigger automatically: (1) adds $20 to `customers.credits`, (2) sets `signup_promo_credit_at` timestamp, (3) logs a `credit_add` transaction, (4) sends a follow-up confirmation email ("You're all set! $20 credit added"), (5) sends a follow-up SMS (if `sms_consent_at` is set) with home-screen save tip. Guards: first card only, one-time per customer, auto-expires after deadline. Uses `SECURITY DEFINER` + `pg_net` for HTTP calls. Migration: `add_signup_promo_credit_trigger`. New column: `customers.signup_promo_credit_at` (timestamptz, nullable).
- **Launch announcement system built:** Admin dashboard functions `sendLaunchAnnouncement(customerId)` (single test) and `sendLaunchAnnouncementAll()` (bulk with confirm + "type LAUNCH" safety gates). Sends branded email + SMS. Email: "We've upgraded your experience" with white logo on navy header, two-step CTA (log in + update payment details), $20 promo callout, green "Open the App" button. SMS: concise version with app link and $20 mention. Bulk SMS respects `sms_consent_at`. **Plan: 10-phase rollout with David's approval at each phase.**
- **David's account reset for testing:** Auth account deleted, customer `profile_id` cleared, payment methods removed, credits zeroed. Customer record and order history preserved. New admin auth account created via Team page. `info@familylaundry.com` temporarily promoted to admin for this, then restored to `laundry_tech`.
- **Charge failure no longer blocks racking:** Previously, if payment failed at rack, the order stayed in Folding. Now: order racks anyway, `billing_status` set to `'failed'`, order appears in Issues tab. Admin can retry charge from Order Details page. On successful retry, `billing_status` is cleared, order moves to Ready, receipt email sends.
- **Receipt email timing fixed:** Removed premature `send-receipt` call at intake (line ~16721 in admin). Receipt now only sends at rack after successful charge, or on successful retry charge from Order Details.
- **iPad kiosk setup:** Two iPads configured with iOS Guided Access for processing center use, one for intake, one for dry room. Both use shared `info@familylaundry.com` account with Laundry Tech view.
- **QA fix: SMS consent check added to promo trigger.** Original trigger sent follow-up SMS to any customer with a phone. Fixed to only send if `sms_consent_at IS NOT NULL`.

**Active cron jobs (as of this session):**
1. `generate-route-runs` — daily at midnight UTC — generates 14-day route schedule
2. `auto-fail-expired-orders` — every 30 min — fails orders past expiry
3. `expire-migration-credits` — daily at 8 AM UTC — zeroes credits where `credit_expires_at` has passed

**⚠️ Note:** The `expire-migration-credits` cron will NOT affect promo credits because the promo trigger does not set `credit_expires_at`. Promo credits persist until used.

**⚠️ File sync issue:** Cowork VM edits to `admin-dashboard/index.html` are not syncing to David's Mac git repo. Launch announcement functions exist in the VM copy but need to be manually synced or the console-paste approach used for Sunday. The phased send scripts will be provided as console-paste snippets.

### Mar 21, 2026 (session 47) — Customer app fixes, payment status icons, toast notifications

- **Fix — Wash temperature default not pre-selected for new customers:** `renderOrderPrefs()` now auto-selects the `is_default` option for every preference group when no customer preferences are saved. New customers see "Warm" pre-highlighted. Addon defaults (e.g. Vinegar "No") are also correctly pre-selected so toggles stay off.
- **Fix — Referral source lost after email confirmation:** Sign-up stored `first_name`, `last_name`, `phone` in Supabase `user_metadata` but not `referral_source` or `sms_consent`. When user confirmed email and returned, all three customer-creation paths (`ensureProfile`, `loadUserData`, `renderConfirmAuth`) couldn't find the referral. Now all five fields are stored in `user_metadata` at sign-up and all creation paths read them back.
- **Payment status icons in Orders list (admin):** New `_payStatusIcon()` helper renders an SVG icon to the left of the dollar amount in the Total column. Shows card-on-file (green credit card), no-card (amber triangle), or on-account (blue building) before payment is processed. Replaced by green `$` after successful charge, red `FAILED` badge on failure, or blue `✔` for invoiced on-account orders. Uses a side-fetch of `customer_payment_methods` in `loadOrders()` to populate `_custWithCard` Set. CSS `.pay-tip` class provides hover tooltips.
- **Toast notifications on all customer profile saves:** Replaced the tiny, easy-to-miss "✓ Saved" text with proper `showToast()` calls on Save Contact, Save Billing, Save Preferences, and Save Notes. Also added error handling (`showToast('Error: ...', 'error')`) to Preferences and Notes saves which previously had none.

---

### Mar 21, 2026 (session 46) — Logo rebrand + PWA icon refresh

- **New Family Laundry logo deployed everywhere:** Replaced the old "Est. 2018" diamond logo with the new "Oakland CA." script logo across all apps. Source file: `assets/FamilyLaundry Logo main.png` (1475×1493 RGBA). Generated 7 logo variants (transparent, navy bg, white bg, login, sidebar, preview) from source using PIL/Pillow.
- **All 6 PWA app icons regenerated:** Admin (navy), Driver (gold), Customer (pink) — all using new logo at 90% width. Both 512px and 180px sizes for each app.
- **Customer icon color iterated:** Started with dusty pink `(219, 182, 196)`, David requested "bright light pink" — updated to `#ff9bec` / `(255, 155, 236)`.
- **PWA app names updated:** `FL Laundry` → `Family Laundry`, `FL Admin` → `Family Laundry Admin`, `FL Driver` → `Family Laundry Driver` (via `apple-mobile-web-app-title` meta tag).
- **Invoice logo URL updated:** Admin invoice now references `https://admin.familylaundry.com/assets/logo_white_bg.png` instead of Supabase storage URL.
- **QA fix — theme-color mismatch:** Customer app `theme-color` meta tag updated from old dusty pink `#f4c2d5` to match new icon color `#ff9bec`.

---

### Mar 21, 2026 (session 45) — Sunday launch prep: SMTP, email branding, geocoding, sign-up flow fix

- **Laura Guevara customer record restored:** Co-founder's account was missing from all CSV exports. Created manually: 55 orders, $35,311.60 lifetime value, 5215 Genoa St Oakland. Will link via phone OTP on Sunday.
- **5 missing Kidango addresses added:** CCELC, Coyote Hills, Hillside, Ryan, Unidos — all geocoded and now visible on admin map (16/16 Kidango accounts).
- **Permanent auto-geocoding built into admin dashboard:** Google Maps Geocoder (`geocodeAddress()` helper) wired into 3 save points: new customer creation, edit address, add address. Also added `geocodeMissing()` bulk utility. API key: `AIzaSyDfIiB3LFbbxiT4szPgpv_jdseTa4HCrEc`.
- **Admin RLS policies for addresses:** Added INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies so geocoding writes succeed (was SELECT-only).
- **Password reset redirect fixed:** Supabase Site URL updated from `washroute.vercel.app` to `https://app.familylaundry.com`. Redirect URLs: `admin.familylaundry.com`, `app.familylaundry.com`, `driver.familylaundry.com`.
- **All 6 Supabase email templates branded as Family Laundry:** Reset Password, Confirm Sign Up, Invite User, Magic Link, Change Email, Reauthentication — all green (#38a169) button styling, Family Laundry branding.
- **SendGrid SMTP configured in Supabase:** Custom SMTP enabled — sender `info@familylaundry.com` / `Family Laundry`, host `smtp.sendgrid.net`, port 587. New "Supabase SMTP" API key created (Full Access). Fixes the 2 emails/hour rate limit. Typo fix: `famillylaundry` → `familylaundry` in sender address was blocking sends.
- **Sign-up → order flow fix (customer app):** Users who signed up via the auth page and confirmed email were shown "Create your account" again at order step 4. Root causes: (a) `ensureProfile()` ran during sign-up without a session → RLS blocked writes → blank data; (b) `loadUserData()` didn't fall back to `user_metadata` for blank profiles; (c) race condition created duplicate customer records. Fixes: `renderConfirmAuth()` now auto-creates customer record from metadata for authenticated users; `handleSignup()` skips `ensureProfile()` without session; `loadUserData()` merges `user_metadata` into blank profiles and has race-condition guard.
- **Unique index on customers.profile_id:** Partial unique index (`WHERE profile_id IS NOT NULL`) prevents duplicate customer records. Orphan records (admin-pre-created, `profile_id IS NULL`) are unaffected.
- **Data cleanup:** Fixed address_cache for Shilling Center, 24 "SF"→"San Francisco" records, Laura Guevara, David Macquart-Moulin. Deleted Joe Blo test data (2 duplicate blank records + profile + auth user).

### Mar 20, 2026 (session 44) — Full order pipeline stress test, customer map improvements, subdomain routing, rebrand

- **Full pipeline stress test (session continuation):** Entire order lifecycle verified end-to-end: customer booking → zone/route assignment → driver pickup (including bag count update and driver note) → processing queue → weight/price calculation → folding → rack → delivery. All stages passed.
- **Per-item pricing fix:** Shirt Service and Air Dry were showing `+$X.XX/bag` — now correctly shows `/item`. Estimate bar and confirm screen both exclude per-item add-ons from bag-multiplied total and show "billed at processing" note. Email confirmation also updated with itemized line items and per-item footnote. Propagated `pricing_type` through `_buildGlobalPrefs()` to all 6 label locations.
- **Folding column gap fix:** Orders moved directly to Folding without going through fold panel arrived with `folded_by_id = null`. Implemented Option B: inline amber warning badge with launderer dropdown on unassigned Folding cards. New `assignFolderInline()` function. `stopPropagation()` prevents card click when selecting launderer.
- **Delivery bag count locked:** Driver was able to edit bag count on delivery stops (should only be editable at pickup). Fixed: delivery stops now show read-only bag count with "Locked at processing" label; `isPickup` flag controls which stepper renders.
- **Family Laundry rebrand:** All visible "WashRoute" text replaced across all 3 apps. Page titles, login screens, SMS sender name, Stripe redirect URLs, Supabase auth redirect URLs, thermal print header all updated.
- **Subdomain routing live:** `app.familylaundry.com`, `driver.familylaundry.com`, `admin.familylaundry.com` all routing correctly. CNAMEs added in Wix DNS (Wix manages nameservers for familylaundry.com, not GoDaddy). `vercel.json` updated with `has` host conditions taking priority over path-based fallbacks. **⚠️ DNS upgrade (low priority):** Vercel recommends CNAME `7e86fe29233068d2.vercel-dns-017.com` but Wix rejects it — leave as `cname.vercel-dns.com` for now, works fine.
- **Customer map — all addresses:** `addCustPins()` now plots every saved address per customer, not just the default. Default address = filled circle (activity color, 24px). Non-default addresses = hollow ring (same color, 16px, white center). Hovering a secondary pin shows the address label (e.g. "Work") in the info card. Pin count footer shows alt address tally.
- **Customer map — zone overlay toggle:** "Show Zones" button added to map legend. Fetches zone polygons via `get_service_zones_geojson` RPC, renders colored fills + dashed outlines on the customer map. Button turns purple / "Hide Zones" when active. Bug fix: geojson must be parsed with `JSON.parse()` before passing to Leaflet (same as `renderZonePolygons` does).
- **Admin — Services tab label:** "Display" renamed to "App Display" on the Services & Pricing tab.
- **Zone overlay debugging + final fix:** Three-step fix process: (1) geojson string parse fix (`JSON.parse` before passing to Leaflet); (2) switched from `L.featureGroup(layers)` wrapper to direct `.addTo(custMap)` per layer; (3) root cause found — `.map-legend-box` CSS had `pointer-events: none`, which silently blocked all click/touch events on the legend including the toggle. Fixed to `pointer-events: auto`. Button replaced with a proper CSS pill toggle (on/off). Zone overlay confirmed working: 6 zones render as colored semi-transparent fills with dashed borders and name tooltips.
- **Color coordination — zone color is single source of truth (commit ae5aff9):**
  - DB: All 10 route templates updated to inherit their zone's color via `UPDATE route_templates SET color = sz.color FROM service_zones sz WHERE rt.zone_id = sz.id`. Driver schedule now automatically uses zone colors for pills.
  - Admin UI: Template editor now fetches `color` field from `service_zones` in `loadZonesIntoSelect`. When a zone is selected, color swatches are hidden and replaced with a colored dot + "Follows zone" badge (via new `syncColorToZone()` function). If no zone is assigned, swatches show as before.
  - `saveTemplate()` reads zone color from the selected option's `data-color`; falls back to swatch only when no zone is assigned.
  - Consequence: you can no longer accidentally set a template to a different color than its zone. Zone → template → driver schedule pill is one consistent color chain.
- **Zone maps — unified clean territory rendering (commits c05b9a1, d1b40bd, 2e7f610):**
  - Problem: each zone was rendering two layers — a hand-drawn polygon AND jagged dashed city boundary outlines (from OSM/Nominatim), creating a visual mess of overlapping shapes.
  - Fix: `get_service_zones_geojson` RPC updated to also return `unified_geojson` — a server-side `ST_Union` of the main polygon and all city polygons merged into one geometry (DROP + recreate required due to return type change).
  - Both `renderZonePolygons()` (Zones map) and `toggleCustZoneOverlay()` (customer map overlay) now use `unified_geojson || geojson`. One clean solid-border shape per zone, no internal borders, no city clutter.
  - Style updated: `weight: 3, lineCap/lineJoin: round`, no `dashArray`. City polygon data is still stored in DB for zone-matching logic — just no longer rendered.
- **Multi-polygon zone editing (commit 9b902a9 + 2 DB migrations):**
  - Problem: drawing a second polygon on a zone replaced the first instead of adding to it.
  - Fix: `_editZonePolygonLayer` (single ref) replaced with `_editZonePolygonLayers` (array). `draw:created` now pushes to the array; `draw:deleted` removes from it. On save, single polygon → `Polygon`, multiple → `MultiPolygon` GeoJSON.
  - `openZoneDetail` uses `L.geoJSON(g).eachLayer(...)` so saved MultiPolygons load back as individually editable layers.
  - DB migration 1: `service_zones.polygon` column widened from `geometry(Polygon, 4326)` → `geometry(Geometry, 4326)` to accept MultiPolygon.
  - DB migration 2: `upsert_service_zone` RPC fixed — removed `::geography` cast (was storing as geography into a geometry column after the type change).
  - Hint text now shows how many areas are active and invites drawing more.
- **Zone geometry hardening (3 additional DB migrations, commits 07c5dad onwards):**
  - Chain of bugs triggered by first MultiPolygon save on Concord: (1) column type `geometry(Polygon)` rejected MultiPolygon → widened to `geometry(Geometry, 4326)`; (2) `upsert_service_zone` was casting to `::geography` → removed cast; (3) drawn polygon had Z dimension → added `ST_Force2D` to `upsert_service_zone`; (4) `get_service_zones_geojson` `ST_Union` crashed on degenerate Nominatim city polygon geometry (single-point ring) → removed city polygons from union; (5) zones still didn't render — `loadAndRenderZones` was silently swallowing RPC errors → added error check with toast; (6) `fitBounds` zoomed to world because degenerate Concord MultiPolygon sub-polygon had null-island coordinates → added `ST_CollectionExtract(ST_MakeValid(...), 3)` to strip degenerate sub-polygons from `ST_AsGeoJSON` output.
  - Final state: `get_service_zones_geojson` applies `ST_CollectionExtract(ST_MakeValid(ST_Force2D(...)), 3)` for both `geojson` and `unified_geojson` — robust against any degenerate geometry in the DB. All 6 zones render cleanly in the Bay Area view.
  - **Lesson:** When allowing user-drawn polygons (Leaflet.Draw), always apply `ST_Force2D` + `ST_MakeValid` + `ST_CollectionExtract` on read, and `ST_Force2D` on write. Nominatim city boundary data can contain degenerate geometry — never trust it in a `ST_Union`.
- **Unified territory includes cities (final DB migration, session 44 wrap-up):**
  - After geometry hardening, city polygons had been removed from `unified_geojson` as a workaround for the crash. David confirmed: delivery zones should display BOTH the hand-drawn polygon AND all assigned cities merged together.
  - Final fix: `get_service_zones_geojson` now sanitizes each city polygon individually with `ST_CollectionExtract(ST_MakeValid(ST_Force2D(...)), 3)` BEFORE passing to `ST_Union` — preventing the earlier GEOS crash. The outer union result is also wrapped in `ST_CollectionExtract(ST_MakeValid(...), 3)`.
  - Result: `unified_geojson` is the true full territory (polygon + all cities merged into one shape). `geojson` remains the raw drawing-layer polygon only (for editing). Both zones maps show the correct merged territory per zone.
  - Concord unified shape: 56,214 bytes (polygon + multiple cities). Hayward: 43,338 bytes. All 6 zones return valid Bay Area centroids.
- **QA fix — `_custZonesData` cache stale after zone saves (session 44 QA):**
  - `toggleCustZoneOverlay()` cached zone data in `_custZonesData` on first toggle. This cache was never cleared when zones were saved/deleted, so the customer overlay would show stale shapes after any zone edit until page reload.
  - Fix: `loadAndRenderZones()` now sets `_custZonesData = null` immediately after a successful RPC fetch, busting the cache so the next overlay toggle always re-fetches fresh data.

### Mar 20, 2026 (session 43) — Services/preferences sync, per-item pricing fix, admin link badge

- **"Yes/Yes" add-on display bug fixed:** Order details were showing "Yes $3.00 / Yes $3.00" instead of preference names like "Vinegar / Oxi". Root cause: `Object.values(draft.prefs)` lost the `groupId` key, so the label lookup fell through to the option label ("Yes"). Fixed by switching to `Object.entries` and looking up group name from `globalPrefs`.
- **Services ↔ Preferences sync architecture implemented (`_buildGlobalPrefs`):** Customer app preferences were completely disconnected from admin Services & Pricing. New `_buildGlobalPrefs(svcs, prefs)` helper runs at load time and: (1) syncs prices from `services` into any linked `preferences` group via `linked_preference_id` FK; (2) auto-generates virtual Yes/No pref groups for any `is_addon` service that has no linked preference yet. Admin is now the single source of truth — change a price in Services and it appears immediately in the customer app.
- **Admin Preferences tab link badge added:** Each preference card now shows a colored chain-link badge indicating whether it is linked to a service in Services & Pricing. Green badge = linked (shows service name + price). Dashed gray badge = unlinked (click to open dropdown and link). Includes an × button to unlink. New functions: `showLinkDrop`, `hideLinkDrop`, `linkPrefToService`, `unlinkPrefService`. Uses `_prefLinkMap` for fast lookup during render.
- **Per-item pricing fixed in customer app:** Shirt Service and Air Dry have `pricing_type = per_item` in the DB but were displaying `+$X.XX/bag` everywhere. Fixed across all 6 locations: checkbox labels in booking flow and account panel now show `/item`; `updateEstimate()` and all three `addonsTotal` calculations no longer multiply per_item add-ons by bag count; estimate bar shows "per-item services billed at processing" note; confirm screen addon rows show unit price + "billed at processing" label and "TBD" for total. `_buildGlobalPrefs` now propagates `pricing_type` onto each preference group from its linked service.
- **DB change:** `Air Dry` and `Shirt Service` services flagged `is_addon = true` in the `services` table.
- **⚠️ Push pending:** Three commits (64ebef0, 386e35e, 820cc25) are committed locally but NOT pushed. David needs to run `git push` from his terminal to deploy to Vercel.

### Mar 19, 2026 (session 42) — Customer activity filters, PostGIS zone filtering, QA cleanup

- **Customer page tabs replaced:** "All / Active / At Risk / Churned" → "All / 7 days / 30 days / 90 days" with "Active within:" label. Filtering uses `last_order_at` instead of `risk_status`. Stat cards show active customer counts per time range.
- **Customer table "Status" column → "Activity":** Badges now show time-based activity (7 days / 30 days / 90 days / 90+ days / No orders) instead of Active/At Risk/Churned. Sort by Activity sorts by `last_order_at`.
- **Map pin colors updated:** Green = last order within 30 days, amber = 30–90 days, gray = 90+ or no orders. Map info card shows "Last order: [date]" instead of risk badge.
- **City dropdown removed from customer filters.** Replaced by zone-only dropdown using PostGIS polygon matching.
- **`customers_in_zone(zone_id)` SQL function created:** Returns customer IDs whose address falls inside the zone's polygon OR whose city matches the zone's `cities` list. Used by the customer page zone dropdown.
- **JS city-name fallback removed from admin route picker** (two instances in `openOpRoutePicker` and `onOrderAddressChange`). Zone detection now relies entirely on the server-side `get_zones_for_point` RPC.
- **New Order form zone matching fixed (QA catch):** `renderNoRoutes()` was still using city-name matching. Now uses `get_zones_for_point` RPC with address lat/lng via new `_noDetectZones()` helper.
- **SMS inbox cleared:** All 8,734 messages deleted for fresh start (904 inbound + 7,830 outbound from mass SMS incident).
- **`washroute-preflight` safety skill created and installed.** Forces a preflight checklist (triggers, cron jobs, SMS templates, blast radius) before any bulk operation. Golden rule: if it could send a message to a customer, assume it will send to every customer.
- **Note:** `recalcRiskStatuses()` still runs on page load and writes `risk_status` to the DB. Harmless but now unused by the UI — can be removed in a future cleanup.

### Mar 19, 2026 (session 41) — Customer data import, address geocoding, SMS emergency shutdown

- **6,930 customers imported from CSV** into `customers` table (from 3 CSV files: ALL Customers to 10/26, FY2025, and 2026). Preferences parsed into structured JSONB format. Notes, referrals, tips, credits, lifetime value all imported. Air Dry and Shirt Service preferences created in the `preferences` table.
- **5,028 structured `addresses` rows created** by parsing `address_cache` strings. 1,876 retail customers (2609 Foothill Blvd) skipped. City names normalized (SF → San Francisco, case fixes). 12 junk records skipped.
- **5,043 addresses geocoded** via Google Maps Geocoding API. Temporary `geocode-addresses` edge function deployed, ran via pg_cron batch job, then deleted. All addresses now have lat/lng coordinates for routing and map display.
- **Admin dashboard paginated** — `loadCustomers()` now uses `.range()` loop to fetch all 6,930 customers (was capped at 1,000 by Supabase default). Client-side pagination at 100/page with Prev/Next controls. City filter dropdown populated from address data.
- **⚠️ SMS EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN:** Imported customers had `sms_consent_at` set, which caused `send-scheduled-reminders` cron jobs and `notify_customer_registered` triggers to fire mass SMS to thousands of non-active customers. Disabled: both reminder cron jobs (removed), both customer registration triggers (dropped), all 13 SMS templates (`sms_enabled = false`).
- **670 STOP opt-outs processed:** 663 customers texted STOP but only 65 had been properly opted out (twilio-webhook had no STOP handler). All 670 now have `sms_consent_at = NULL`.
- **`twilio-webhook` v27 deployed:** Claude AI completely removed. Now handles ONLY: STOP (clears `sms_consent_at`), START (re-sets consent), SKIP, PICKUP, HELP. All other messages → human inbox with no auto-reply.
- **Lesson learned:** Before any bulk data import, disable all automated outbound messaging (cron jobs, triggers, templates) FIRST. Re-enable selectively after import, with filters to target only active customers.
- **Google Maps API key:** Was unrestricted for geocoding. David needs to re-restrict it in Google Cloud Console now that geocoding is complete.
- **Next:** Re-enable SMS templates selectively with proper scoping. Dashboard UX improvements (city/zone filtering, customer page redesign). Git push needed for dashboard pagination commit.

### Mar 19, 2026 (session 40) — Billing audit, On Account billing, schedule lock fix, QA hardening

- **Print button on all kanban panels (commit `306bd5e`):** 🖨 button added to Intake, Fold, and Rack panel headers. Calls `printBagTag(activeOrder?.id)`. Icon doubled in size (`font-size:24px`).
- **Simplified Fold and Rack panel titles (commit `6658f33`):** Removed "— Fold & Pack" and "— Change/Assign Rack" suffixes. Panel headers now show just the customer name.
- **Weight prefill on Intake re-entry (commit `0f9c08e`):** When an order is dragged back to Intake from Cleaning, the weight field now prefills with the existing `weight_lbs` instead of starting at 0. Save button enables immediately if weight exists.
- **Double-charge bug fix (commit `dae110f`):** `_buildIntakeLineItems()` was creating both a preference `price_mod` item ("Vinegar: Yes $3") AND a linked service item ("Vinegar × 1 bag $3"), doubling the charge. Fixed to only use the linked service when one exists. Added `_dedupeLineItems()` and `_findStaleLineItemIdxs()` helpers to filter stale "Name: Yes" entries from all display paths. Cleaned up orders #147, #146, #141 in the database.
- **Billing consistency audit (commit `183807b`):** `opSaveDetails()` used `type:'fee'` instead of `'delivery_fee'` and different overage label format — aligned with `_buildIntakeLineItems()`. `printBagTag()` now uses `_dedupeLineItems()`. `send-receipt` edge function v21 deployed: added `pref_service` to `DISPLAY_TYPES`, added `dedupeLineItems()`, tightened credit filter.
- **Folding status in STATUS_FLOW (commit `4eb54b2`):** `folding` was missing from `STATUS_FLOW`, `statusBadge`, status dropdown, and `_OP_STATUS_LABELS`. Orders in folding status showed "Fully Delivered" as advance button and "Processing" as badge. Fixed across all four locations.
- **Outstanding balance fix (commit `4e94375`):** Customer billing panel used `billing_status` (unused column, always null) instead of `stripe_payment_intent_id` to detect paid orders. All charged orders appeared as "unpaid". Fixed to filter by `stripe_payment_intent_id IS NULL`.
- **Orders tab blank on refresh (commit `105d5e3`):** `loadAll()` called `loadOrders()` with no filter (defaulting to `'scheduled'`), racing against the hash-restored `loadOrders('in_process')`. If `loadAll` finished last, it overwrote `currentOrderFilter` and rendered the wrong tab — appearing blank. Fixed `loadAll()` to pass `currentOrderFilter`, removed duplicate `loadOrders` call in `showPage()`, and made `switchOrdersView` hash reflect actual filter.
- **On Account billing (commits `5ac40f5` → `e90a73b`):** Full end-to-end `billing_type='on_account'` support. Skip Stripe auto-charge at racking — balance accumulates naturally. Guards added at all 4 automatic charge points (saveRacking, opSetOrderStatus, batchSetStatus, batchAdvanceOrders). Manual Bill Orders flow intentionally NOT guarded since admin is deliberately charging. `billing_type` added to 6 customer query selects. Visual indicators: ✔ Invoiced (blue) on Rack cards, Orders list, and panel headers; ◻ Outstanding / ✅ Paid on Billing tab rows. Paid rows dimmed + checkbox disabled to prevent double-charging. `confirmBilling()` filters out already-paid orders. Receipt email skipped at racking for on-account; sent after successful Bill Orders charge instead.
- **Schedule lock fix (commit `a9d88c5`):** Lock logic required `isComplete && windowClosed` — incomplete routes (with failed stops) never locked. Changed to lock on `windowClosed` alone (`isPast || (isToday && windowClosed)`). Applied to pickup cells, delivery cells, and driver reassignment popover.
- **Orders page tab rename (commit `a278fcd`):** "Orders" → "List", "Order Schedule" → "Map".
- **QA fixes (commit `5c160d4`):** Fixed `loadOrders()` race condition at 2 additional call sites (retryChargeFromIssues, add-order). Escaped single quotes in email/name interpolations in onclick attributes to prevent XSS via malformed DB values.
- **Schedule lock visual fix (commit `7f7b44c`):** Today's locked cells (window_end + 2hr passed) had no visual indicator — no 🔒 icon, no dimming, only `cursor:default`. Looked identical to unlocked cells. Now all locked cells show 🔒 and reduced opacity (0.7 for today, 0.45 for past). Applied to both Drivers page and Orders page schedule grids.
- **Next session priorities:**
  1. David creating final Zones and Route templates for testing
  2. SMS Phase 2 — natural-language cancellations ("cancel Thursday") — needs `conversations` table
  3. Launderer reporting Phase 2 — date range mode
  4. Route picker fine-tuning (backlog)

### Mar 19, 2026 (session 39) — Order details locked after Intake + Details tab redesign + addon label fix + paid order freeze

- **Design decision: order details locked after Intake.** David changed his mind about details being editable at every kanban step — too much risk of errors. Now: Intake is the only place to edit order details inline. After pushing to Cleaning, the order is locked. To re-edit: (a) drag card back to Intake, or (b) use the Order Details page (manager view).
- **Simplified Cleaning/Folding flow (commit `94b39e6`):** No more "next step" buttons. Cleaning → tap card → select folder → auto-advances to Folding. Folding → tap card → select rack → auto-charges and advances to Rack. `openFoldPanel()` and `openRackPanel()` show read-only order summaries. `intakeNextStep()` simplified to only handle Intake column. `_intakeEditMode` flag removed entirely.
- **Order Details tab — read-only/edit toggle (commit `a6fa27b`):** Two-state design with `_opDetailsEditing` flag. Read-only view (`opRenderDetailsReadonly()`) shows bags, weight, add-on chips, line_items breakdown, total, notes as text. Edit mode (`opEnterDetailsEdit()`) populates inputs, builds toggleable add-on chips from `_opEditAddons` (index-keyed object). `opToggleAddon(idx)` flips add-ons on/off. `opSaveDetails()` rebuilds line_items from toggled-on add-ons, saves to DB, re-renders read-only view, and syncs kanban via `reloadColumns('intake','cleaning','folding','rack')`.
- **"Processed by" in order summaries (commit `bce9762`):** Fold and Rack panels now query `folded_by_id` and show "Processed by 👤 [name]" using `allLaunCache`.
- **Fix "Yes $3.00" phantom line items (commit `910de48`):** `_buildIntakeLineItems()` was iterating `allPreferencesCache` but using only `sel.label` (e.g. "Yes") without the group name. Fixed to use `${g.name}: ${sel.label}` and skip items where `priceMod <= 0`. New `pref_service` line_item type introduced — updated in 6+ display/filter locations.
- **Paid orders bypass fold panel (commit `7f96eac`):** Added `stripe_payment_intent_id` guard at top of `openFoldPanel()` — paid orders go straight to `openRackPanel()`. Details tab hides Edit button for paid orders.
- **Rack panel auto-advance:** Removed manual save button, added charging indicator (`#rack-charging`). `selectRack()` calls `saveRacking()` immediately on selection.
- **Next session priorities:**
  1. SMS Phase 2 — natural-language cancellations ("cancel Thursday") — needs `conversations` table
  2. Launderer reporting Phase 2 — date range mode
  3. Route picker fine-tuning (backlog)

### Mar 19, 2026 (session 38) — Kanban tap-to-edit UX overhaul + paid order protection + iPad Safari fix

- **Tap-to-edit kanban cards (commits `2fe09d7`, `4fc8d4e`, `c801c68`):** Removed all action buttons from kanban cards. Tapping any card now opens the intake/edit panel. Each step has a single context-aware button that saves changes AND advances the order: Intake → "Save & Start Processing", Cleaning → "Save & Assign to Folder", Folding → "Save & Charge → Rack". `openIntakePanel(orderId, editMode)` accepts an `editMode` flag for re-editing from Cleaning/Folding columns.
- **Shared `_buildIntakeLineItems()` helper:** Extracted line_items builder into a reusable function used by both `saveIntake()` and `intakeNextStep()`. Handles base bags, overage, add-ons, preference-linked services, delivery fees, and credits.
- **`intakeNextStep()` context-aware handler:** Reads `procActiveOrder.status` to determine behavior — `picked_up` runs the full `saveIntake()` flow (save + print tag + receipt); `processing` saves changes then opens fold panel; `folding` saves changes then opens rack panel.
- **Paid order protection (commits `4fc8d4e`, `2c0eb00`, `075fce3`):** Orders with `stripe_payment_intent_id` show ✅ Paid badge in ALL columns. Tapping a paid card goes straight to `openRackPanel()` — no edit panel. Both intake queries (`loadProcessing` and `loadIntakeCol`) now include `stripe_payment_intent_id` and `weight_lbs` in the SELECT.
- **Removed functions:** `intakeSaveOnly()`, `_intakeSaveChanges()` — no longer needed after removing "Save Changes Only" button.
- **Simplified `updateIntakeSaveBtn()`:** Now just checks weight > 0 to enable the single action button.
- **iPad/Safari touch fix (commit `6b9ecdf`):** `touchStartOrder()` was calling `event.preventDefault()` immediately, blocking `onclick` from firing on iOS Safari. Refactored to tap-vs-drag pattern: touchstart records position only, touchmove checks 10px threshold before initiating drag, touchend calls `card.click()` if no drag occurred. New state vars: `_tdTapStart`, `_tdDragStarted`.
- **Next session priorities:**
  1. SMS Phase 2 — natural-language cancellations ("cancel Thursday")
  2. Launderer reporting Phase 2 — date range mode
  3. Route picker fine-tuning (backlog)

### Mar 19, 2026 (session 37) — Phone numbers removed from all apps; twilio-webhook v26

- **Decision: remove all phone number references from apps (commit `4a35422`):** David decided not to list any phone numbers in the customer or admin apps. A Google search surfaces the voicemail number if needed. All `(510) 842-3560` and `(510) 588-4102` references replaced with `familylaundry.com` across:
  - `customer-app/index.html`: footer, "Prefer to call?" link (removed entirely), "Need help?" order-step link, service-area error messages, email template footer.
  - `admin-dashboard/index.html`: receipt printer footer line, thermal receipt print footer, email receipt footer, invoice address block.
- **`twilio-webhook` upgraded to v26:** All "call (510) 842-3560" references in error SMS messages and the Claude AI system prompt replaced with `familylaundry.com`. STATUS keyword references and HELP menu were also cleaned up in v22–v25 (session 36 continued):
  - STATUS keyword removed from HELP menu and Claude system prompt — natural language handles status questions.
  - "Call (510) 588-4102 for anything else." removed from HELP message.
- **HELP message (current, v26):**
  ```
  Family Laundry 🧺
  PICKUP — Book a pickup
  SKIP — Skip your next pickup
  Or just text us anything — "where's my order?", "is my laundry done?" — we'll understand!
  ```
- **Next session priorities:**
  1. SMS Phase 2 — natural-language cancellations ("cancel Thursday") — needs `conversations` table
  2. Route picker fine-tuning (backlog)

### Mar 18, 2026 (session 32) — SMS notification pipeline fixed: 3 edge functions + message template consolidation

- **Root cause: wrong Twilio secret name in all 3 notification functions.** `Deno.env.get('TWILIO_FROM_PHONE')` returned `undefined` — the actual Supabase secret is named `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`. This caused `TWILIO_FROM = ''` silently, and Twilio rejected every outbound SMS request without throwing an exception visible in logs. Fixed in `send-order-notification`, `send-scheduled-reminders`, and `on-customer-created` — all now use `Deno.env.get('TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER') ?? Deno.env.get('TWILIO_FROM_PHONE') ?? ''` (fallback chain keeps backward compatibility).

- **`send-order-notification` v16 deployed — 404 bug fixed (3 compounding issues):**
  1. **Embedded resource query failing:** `.select('id, ..., customers(id, ...)')` PostgREST join was returning 404 silently in the service-role edge function context. Fixed by splitting into two separate Supabase queries: orders first, then customers by `order.customer_id`. More robust and debuggable regardless of root cause.
  2. **Wrong Twilio secret name** (see above).
  3. **Phone not E.164 formatted:** `phone_cache` stores plain digits (`4156085446`); Twilio requires `+14156085446`. `sendSms()` now normalizes: strips non-digit/non-`+` chars, prepends `+1` for US 10-digit numbers if no `+` prefix. This was silently discarding every SMS.
  - Added detailed `console.error` logging before any 404 return so future errors are diagnosable in Supabase logs.

- **`send-scheduled-reminders` v13 deployed — Twilio fix + template simplification:**
  - Same `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` fix.
  - v12 intermediate: added `recurring_interval` to order select and added branching logic for recurring vs one-time customers to pick different templates.
  - v13 final: after DB template consolidation (see below), all branching removed — `runDayBefore()` now uses a single `pickup_reminder_recurring` template for all orders. Cleaner and easier to maintain.

- **`on-customer-created` v10 deployed:** Same `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` fix. No functional changes.

- **`message_templates` DB — template consolidation (14 templates now, down from 15):**
  - Deleted `pickup_reminder_one_time` row — redundant with the recurring variant.
  - Renamed `pickup_reminder_recurring` label from "Pickup Reminder — Recurring (Day Before)" → **"Day-Before Pickup Reminder"** and set `sort_order = 15`. This is the canonical day-before reminder for all customers.
  - Confirmed that `send-scheduled-reminders` was already reading from the `message_templates` DB table via `getTemplate()` — it was never hardcoded. David's concern that the scheduler used a different source was a misunderstanding; all 15 (now 14) templates are fully editable from Admin → Notifications → Message Templates.
  - **Canonical template list — 14 templates (all editable in Admin → Notifications → Message Templates):**

    | # | `trigger_key` | Label | Cat | SMS body | Email subject |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | 1 | `customer_registered` | Customer Registration | account | "Hi {{first_name}}, Welcome to Family Laundry! We'll send you important order updates via SMS like "Your laundry is ready." Text STOP to unsubscribe." | *(none)* |
    | 2 | `order_confirmed` | Order Confirmed | order | "Thank you, {{first_name}}! Your pickup at {{address}} is scheduled for {{pickup_date}} between {{time_window}}." | "Your Family Laundry Order is Confirmed 🧺" |
    | 3 | `driver_on_way_pickup` | Driver On the Way (Pickup) | order | "Hi {{customer_first_name}}! {{driver_first_name}} is on the way to pick up your laundry and should arrive within 15 minutes. Please place your bags outside." | "Your Driver is On the Way" |

If you don't have laundry this week, reply SKIP and we'll see you next time. For safety, please keep bags under 30 lbs and remember to check pockets for keys, pens, coins, and AirPods. Thank you!" | *(none)* |
    | 14 | `pickup_day_reminder` | Pickup Day Reminder (Morning of) | reminders | "Good morning from Family Laundry! Today's the day. Your pickup is scheduled between {{time_window}}. Our driver will text you when they are on the way." | *(none)* |

    **Trigger status for all 14 templates:**
    | Template | Trigger | Confirmed working |
    |---|---|---|
    | `customer_registered` | `on-customer-created` edge fn fires on new customer row | ✅ |
    | `order_confirmed` | `send-order-notification` called from customer app `placeOrder()` | ✅ |
    | `driver_on_way_pickup` | `notify-on-my-way` called from driver app "On My Way" button | ✅ |

    | `payment_received` | `charge-order` v23 calls `send-order-notification` on successful charge | ✅ Wired session 32b |
    | `payment_failed` | `charge-order` v23 calls `send-order-notification` when all cards declined | ✅ Wired session 32b |
    | `review_request` | `send-scheduled-reminders` v14 `runReviewRequest()` — 2 days after delivery | ✅ Wired session 32b |
    | `reorder_reminder` | `send-scheduled-reminders` v14 `runReorder()` — 18-25 days after delivery | ✅ |
    | `pickup_reminder_recurring` | `send-scheduled-reminders` v14 `runDayBefore()` — evening before pickup | ✅ |
    | `pickup_day_reminder` | `send-scheduled-reminders` v14 `runDayOf()` — morning of pickup | ✅ Confirmed by David |

    Templates with email subjects also have full HTML email bodies stored in the DB (editable in admin): `order_confirmed`, `driver_on_way_pickup`, `order_picked_up`, `driver_on_way_delivery`, `order_delivered`, `payment_received`, `payment_failed`, `review_request`.

    **Source of truth:** All edge functions read message bodies from the `message_templates` DB table. Admin → Notifications → Message Templates is the single source of truth. No messages are hardcoded.

- **Session 32b additions (same session, continued):**

- **Proof photo now required before stop completion (driver app):** The complete button was already disabled until a photo is uploaded (built in session 31). Added a programmatic safety guard in `completeStop()` that blocks completion if `proof_photo_url` is null, in case the disabled attribute is bypassed. The file input (`capture="environment"`) opens the rear camera on mobile but also allows gallery selection — so drivers in low/no-signal areas can take the photo with their native camera app, then select it from gallery when they have connectivity to upload.

- **`send-scheduled-reminders` v14 deployed — review request trigger wired:**
  - New `runReviewRequest()` function. Finds orders delivered 44–56 hours ago (the "2 days after" window) with `review_request_sent_at IS NULL`. Reads the `review_link` URL from `settings` table (Admin → Settings). Substitutes `{{first_name}}` and `{{review_link}}` into the `review_request` template. Only sends one review request per customer ever (deduplicates across orders). Skips entirely if no `review_link` is configured in settings.
  - Runs automatically as part of `type: 'all'`, `type: 'morning'`, or `type: 'review'`.

- **Review link setting added to admin Settings:**
  - New `review_link TEXT` column on `settings` table (migration `add_review_link_to_settings`). Seeded with the Yelp "Write a Review" URL.
  - New card in Admin → Settings below the Printer card: "Review Link" with a URL input, save button, and a hint explaining it maps to `{{review_link}}` in the Review Request template. Editable at any time — change from Yelp to Google or anything else without touching code.

- **`charge-order` v23 deployed — payment notifications wired:**
  - Added `notifyCustomer(orderId, event)` helper — fire-and-forget call to `send-order-notification` using the service role key.
  - On successful charge: fires `payment_received` → customer gets "Payment of $XX.XX received for order #YYY" SMS.
  - When all cards fail: fires `payment_failed` → customer gets "we couldn't process your payment… Please update your card in the app" SMS.
  - Both templates were already in `message_templates` and editable in Notifications — they just had no trigger until now.

- **Session 32c — Full trigger audit and system cleanup:**

- **`auto_fail_expired_orders()` rewritten — no more hardcoded SMS (migration `auto_fail_use_templates_v2`):**
  The cron function that auto-fails expired pickups/deliveries every 30 minutes was the last place with hardcoded SMS message text (bypassing `message_templates`). Rewritten to read the `pickup_failed` template from `message_templates` at the start of each run, interpolate `{{first_name}}`, and send via `send-sms`. Now 100% of outbound SMS in the system goes through editable templates.

- **Redundant `create_recurring_orders()` cron job removed (migration `cleanup_orphan_cron_and_dead_code`):**
  Cron job #2 (`0 8 * * *`) was calling `create_recurring_orders()` daily — an older approach that scanned all recurring customers and created next orders. This was made redundant by the DB trigger `trg_create_recurring_order_fn` (session 5) which fires instantly on order delivery/skip. The cron and its function (`create_recurring_orders()`) were both removed (migration `drop_redundant_create_recurring_orders_fn`).

- **Orphan function `trg_create_recurring_order()` dropped (migration `cleanup_orphan_cron_and_dead_code`):**
  Old version of the recurring order trigger function, replaced by `trg_create_recurring_order_fn` in session 5 (added `cancelled_by = 'customer'` guard). No trigger referenced it. Dropped.

- **Dead `ready_for_pickup` reference removed from `sync_order_status_from_stops()` (migration `cleanup_orphan_cron_and_dead_code`):**
  Status `ready_for_pickup` was removed from the system in session 6, but this trigger function still checked for it. The branch was unreachable (DB constraint prevents the status from existing). Removed for clarity.

- **`create-test-user` edge function:** Already neutralized (returns 404). Cannot delete via MCP — David should delete from Supabase dashboard: Edge Functions → create-test-user → Delete.

- **Post-audit state:** Zero orphan trigger functions. Zero orphan cron jobs. Zero hardcoded SMS messages. All 14 notification templates read from `message_templates` DB. 4 active cron jobs (route generation, day-before reminders, morning reminders, auto-fail). 22 active edge functions (23 minus `create-test-user` pending manual deletion).

- **DB migrations this session (all 32a/b/c combined):**
  - `add_review_link_to_settings` — `ALTER TABLE settings ADD COLUMN review_link TEXT DEFAULT ''`
  - `add_review_request_sent_at_to_orders` — `ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN review_request_sent_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NULL`
  - `auto_fail_use_templates_v2` — rewrote `auto_fail_expired_orders()` to use template system
  - `cleanup_orphan_cron_and_dead_code` — removed cron #2, dropped orphan function, cleaned dead code
  - `drop_redundant_create_recurring_orders_fn` — dropped `create_recurring_orders()` function

- **Next session priorities:**
  1. Test order confirmation SMS end-to-end — place a new order from the customer app, verify SMS arrives
  2. Delete `create-test-user` edge function from Supabase dashboard
  3. Continue Order Schedule (RCC) bug hunting (session 31 carried forward)
  4. Test CloudPRNT with physical printer
  5. Investigate `optimize-route` v12 stop reordering issue (session 28 backlog)

### Mar 17, 2026 (session 31) — Driver app stop badges, time windows, rack check; fix phantom time band

- **Pickup/delivery pill badges on stop cards (commit `a522084`):** Every stop card now shows a permanent 🧺 Pickup or 📦 Delivery pill alongside the status badge (Done/Skipped/etc.). Previously pending stops showed no type indicator — drivers had to infer from the circle color. Used existing `sb-pickup`/`sb-delivery` CSS classes. Guard added for stops missing `stop_type`.

- **Full time window display:** Route header subtitle changed from "2 stops · not started yet" to "1 pickup · 1 delivery · not started yet" in the planning view. Home screen peek cards and planning view banner now show the full window range "6:00 PM – 8:00 PM" instead of "Starts at 6:00 PM". New `fmtWindowTime()` and `fmtWindowRange(tmpl)` helpers added above `fmtDate()`.

- **Rack Check pre-departure checklist:** A 📋 Bag Check section now appears in the planning view (2 hours before route opens) for all delivery stops. Drivers tap "✓ On Rack" or "Missing" per bag; progress counter updates live; all-clear shows green "ready to go" banner; missing bags show red "contact dispatch" warning. State stored in `localStorage` keyed by `wr-rack-{routeId}-{date}`. Scroll position preserved in `renderRoute()` so tapping check buttons doesn't jump to top. Note: rack check is intentionally in planning view only for now; a future iteration could add `rack_checked_at` to `route_stops` for admin visibility.

- **Fix: phantom "10–12 PM" time band in Order Schedule (commit `a522084`):** The RCC column's `getUtcMins()` bucketing function used `pickup_window_start` for all stops. For same-day turnaround orders (picked up AM, delivered PM on a different route), the delivery stop's `pickup_window_start` was the morning AM slot (e.g. 16:00 UTC = 9 AM PDT). This created a 3rd spurious bucket that the position-based label formula called "10–12 PM". Fix: delivery stops now bucket by `delivery_window_start`; pickup stops bucket by `pickup_window_start`. The phantom band disappears and delivery stops group correctly with their delivery time window.

- **Next session priorities:**
  1. Continue hunting and fixing Order Schedule bugs David spotted
  2. Test full stop detail flow end-to-end as Davey Crockett (en route → I've Arrived → bags → photo → complete)
  3. Test CloudPRNT with physical printer
  4. Investigate `optimize-route` v12 stop reordering issue (from session 28)

### Mar 17, 2026 (session 30d) — Route driver sync fix

- **Fix: RCC showed wrong driver for Oakland PM (migration `fix_generate_route_runs_set_driver_id`):** The nightly `generate_route_runs` cron function was correctly reading `route_driver_schedule` and setting `pickup_driver_id` / `delivery_driver_id` on new route records, but never populated `driver_id`. The RCC displays driver name from `routes.driver_id`, so it showed a stale/wrong driver (Marcus Williams) instead of the scheduled one (David). Root cause: an older version of the function only used `driver_id`; when it was refactored to use the per-leg fields, `driver_id` was accidentally dropped from the INSERT. Fixed `generate_route_runs` to also set `driver_id = pickup_drv` at INSERT time. All three fields now stay in sync at route creation.

- **Data fix for today's Oakland PM route:** Updated the route record directly — set `driver_id`, `pickup_driver_id`, and `delivery_driver_id` all to David (UUID `7d84e3e9`). Had to use two separate UPDATEs because the `trg_sync_route_driver` trigger fires BEFORE UPDATE and clears `pickup/delivery_driver_id` whenever `driver_id` changes — so the first UPDATE set `driver_id`, and the second (which didn't change `driver_id`) restored the per-leg fields. The `cascade_route_driver_to_stops` trigger automatically updated the delivery stop to David as well.

- **⚠️ Note on `trg_sync_route_driver` trigger:** This BEFORE UPDATE trigger clears `pickup_driver_id` and `delivery_driver_id` any time `driver_id` is changed via the admin Driver Schedule UI. This is defensively correct (prevents stale per-leg overrides after a manual reassignment), but means `pickup/delivery_driver_id` will be NULL after any UI-driven reassignment. The RCC only reads `driver_id` so this is fine in practice — but worth keeping in mind if we ever add logic that reads the per-leg fields in the UI.

- **Next session priorities:**
  1. Test full stop detail flow end-to-end as Davey Crockett (en route → I've Arrived → bags → photo → complete)
  2. Investigate `optimize-route` v12 stop reordering issue (from session 28)
  3. Test CloudPRNT with physical printer

### Mar 17, 2026 (session 30c) — Email receipt + auth re-linking fixes

- **Fix: email receipt not sent on Folding → Rack (commit `6068c8a`):** `saveRacking()` in admin dashboard charged the card and advanced the order to `ready_for_delivery` but never called `send-receipt`. The only auto-receipt trigger was the POS intake flow. Added a fire-and-forget `send-receipt` fetch identical to the POS pattern. Delivery customers now receive their receipt automatically when their order is racked.

- **Fix: magic link sign-in creating blank customer account (commit `778e9d8`):** `ensureProfile()` had two lookup steps — find customer by `profile_id`, or find an orphan with matching `email_cache` and `profile_id IS NULL`. If a customer originally signed up via phone OTP (giving them a phone-auth UUID as `profile_id`), signing in via email magic link (a different UUID) hit neither case and created a fresh blank customer record. Added step 2b: check for existing customer with matching `email_cache` regardless of `profile_id` status; if found, re-point `profile_id` to the current auth user. Deleted two orphaned duplicate records that had been created for `dmacquart@gmail.com`. Note: a partial unique index on `profile_id WHERE NOT NULL` would prevent the race condition that created two duplicates simultaneously — low priority but worth adding as a future migration.

- **Next session priorities:**
  1. Test full stop detail flow end-to-end as Davey Crockett (en route → I've Arrived → bags → photo → complete)
  2. Investigate `optimize-route` v12 stop reordering issue (from session 28)
  3. Test CloudPRNT with physical printer

### Mar 17, 2026 (session 30) — Driver first name in SMS + notification blast-radius fixes

- **Driver name personalization in "On My Way" SMS (commit `62657b0`):** Updated `driver_on_way_pickup` and `driver_on_way_delivery` templates in `message_templates` DB to use `{{customer_first_name}}` and `{{driver_first_name}}` tags. Example: "Hi Sarah! Davey is on the way to pick up your laundry…" instead of the generic "Family Laundry Update: your driver is on the way…"

- **`notify-on-my-way` v20 — template-driven + driver first name:** Rewrote edge function to read message body from `message_templates` table (was hardcoded). Supports `{{customer_first_name}}`, `{{driver_first_name}}`, `{{action_word}}` interpolation. Driver app previously passed full name (`David Macquart-Moulin`); fixed `sendOnMyWay()` to pass only `currentProfile?.first_name`.

- **`send-scheduled-reminders` v11 — morning reminder timing fix:** `runDayOf()` used `pickup_window_start >= now` which missed pickups whose window started exactly at cron fire time (7am cron, 7am window → `>= now` at 14:00:03 UTC, window_start = 14:00:00 UTC). Fixed to `pickup_window_end >= now` so any order whose window hasn't closed yet is included.

- **`send-order-notification` v15 — blast radius fix for driver name (commit `62657b0`):** QA caught that `send-order-notification` also fires the `driver_on_way_delivery` template (when admin advances `out_for_delivery` status) but had `driver_first_name: ''` in its vars. SMS would read "Hi Sarah! is on the way with your clean laundry…". Fixed: function now fetches the delivery stop's assigned driver (explicit `driver_id` or route default) and populates `driver_first_name` from their profile. Also added `customer_first_name` as an alias for `first_name` for consistency. v15 deployed.

- **Admin Notifications merge tags updated:** Replaced `{{driver_name}}` (was populated as empty string) with `{{driver_first_name}}` and `{{customer_first_name}}` in the tag picker. Old templates using `{{driver_name}}` still work (maps to same value via `driver_name` alias in the vars object).

- **Fix: "Est. Delivery" → "Delivery" in confirmation emails (commit `17b2122`):** Label updated in both the customer app booking confirmation email and the admin dashboard "New Order" email.

- **Fix: pickup_failed SMS never sending (commit `5c294ea`):** Driver app was passing `order_id` (snake_case) to `send-order-notification` but the edge function expects `orderId` (camelCase). The "Pickup Failed" SMS had silently never sent since the feature was built. Fixed to `orderId`.

- **Driver app design overhaul — "Jony Ive" pass (commit `a9b04a7`):** Full visual redesign requested with emphasis on "less colors, only relevant information, same-size buttons, compact, beautiful." QA pass found one Low issue (dead `.btn-fail-stop` CSS) which was fixed before commit. Changes:
  - Unified all action blues to `var(--accent)` — removed 6 hardcoded `#1a73e8` values
  - Button hierarchy: primary filled → outlined skip/fail → text link back/sms (3 levels vs previous 10+)
  - Stop cards: removed PICKUP/DELIVERY type badge for pending stops; neutral gray map icon (was blue)
  - Stop detail customer section: removed redundant name row (name is in header); collapsed phone + SMS into one row
  - Stop detail order section: removed order # and service name rows; kept only bag count + preference tags
  - Phase 1 (pre-arrival): removed 📲 emoji, removed hint text; simplified "Skip notification" → "I'm already here"
  - Phase 1 (en-route): en-route chip changed from green (#f0fdf4) to neutral gray; removed ✅ emoji and hint text from "I've Arrived"
  - Phase 2 both sub-phases: removed arrival chip entirely; Maps link moved to bag section title as small ↗ text link (sub-phase 1 only)
  - Phase 2 sub-phase 2: reordered buttons (Complete first, Back as text link, separator, Skip, Fail); Fail unified to skip style with red overrides

- **Next session priorities:**
  1. Test full stop detail flow end-to-end as Davey Crockett (en route → I've Arrived → bags → photo → complete)
  2. Investigate `optimize-route` v12 stop reordering issue (from session 28)
  3. Test CloudPRNT with physical printer

### Mar 17, 2026 (session 29) — Driver app stop detail overhaul + RLS driver fix

- **Stop detail — En Route intermediate stage (commit `a2c40f5`):** "I'm On My Way" no longer auto-advances to bags/notes. Driver stays on Phase 1 with a green en-route chip, Maps button, and a prominent "I've Arrived" CTA. `openStop()` always starts at Phase 1 — QA caught that the old auto-advance to Phase 2 for `en_route` stops would skip the arrival screen if a driver closed and reopened a stop mid-drive.

- **Stop detail — Back button on photo screen (commit `a2c40f5`):** Sub-phase 2 (photo) now has "← Back" to return to sub-phase 1 (bags/notes). `prevSubPhase()` function added.

- **Stop detail — Text Customer SMS button (commit `a2c40f5`):** "💬 Text Customer" link added to customer section on all active stops with a phone. Opens native SMS app. Shown only on active (not completed/skipped/failed) stops.

- **Home screen — Later Today strip:** Upcoming routes shown collapsed with route names + start times. Only routes within the 2-hour pre-window show as full cards.

- **Home screen — removed Next Stop section:** Home only shows route summary cards. Spacing and top padding increased.

- **RLS fix — driver_id IS NULL stops invisible (migration `fix_driver_rls_null_driver_id`):** Root cause: `driver_read_assigned_orders`, `driver_update_assigned_orders`, and `driver_update_assigned_stops` policies only matched stops with an explicit `driver_id`. Stops with `driver_id = NULL` (inheriting from route) were silently blocked. Drivers saw "No Stops Today" even with correctly assigned routes. Fixed all three policies to add `(rs.driver_id IS NULL AND r.driver_id = current_driver_id())` branch.

- **Automation trigger — trg_sync_route_driver (migration `trg_sync_route_driver_on_reassign`):** DB trigger that fires BEFORE UPDATE on `routes`. When `driver_id` changes, auto-clears `pickup_driver_id`/`delivery_driver_id` to NULL. Prevents stale legacy fields from blocking RLS checks after any schedule reassignment — no admin manual cleanup needed.

- **Admin fix — rccMoveStop resets driver_id to NULL:** When dragging a stop between routes in the RCC, `driver_id` is now explicitly reset to NULL so the stop inherits the destination route's default driver rather than keeping the old explicit assignment.

- **Design principle added:** Always prefer automation triggers over manual process. When data needs to stay in sync, use DB triggers/RLS — never require an extra admin step.

- **Next session priorities:**
  1. Test full stop detail flow end-to-end as Davey Crockett (en route → I've Arrived → bags → photo → complete)
  2. Investigate `optimize-route` v12 stop reordering issue (from session 28)
  3. Test CloudPRNT with physical printer

### Mar 16, 2026 (session 28) — RCC time-window section dividers

- **RCC column split by 2-hour booking window (commit `51cc2b8`):** Routes with `arrival_window_hours > 0` (e.g., Berkeley PM with 2-hour slots) now display a labelled section header between each time window group in the RCC column. Example: Berkeley PM shows a "6–8 PM" divider above the 6–8 PM customers and an "8–10 PM" divider above the 8–10 PM customers. Stops within each section remain in their original `stop_number` order.

- **Implementation details:** `arrival_window_hours` added to the `_dsTemplates` SELECT in `loadDailyRuns()`. In `rccRenderColumns()`, stops are grouped by extracting the UTC hour+minute from `orders.pickup_window_start` (or `delivery_window_start` as fallback). Unique UTC-minute buckets are sorted ascending; each maps to a local-time slot label computed from the template's `window_start` + `arrival_window_hours`. Label format: `"6–8 PM"`, `"8–10 PM"` etc. Routes with only one time window (or `arrival_window_hours = 0`) fall through to the original plain render with no dividers — no regression. CSS class `.rcc-window-divider` added; `.rcc-first-div` removes top margin on the first divider per column.

- **No template changes** — David confirmed templates are correctly structured (6–10 PM, 2-hour slots). This was a pure front-end display enhancement.

- **Next session priorities:**
  1. Investigate why `optimize-route` v12 isn't reordering stops (Marcus=1, Priya=2, Sam=3, Alex=4, Jake=5 unchanged). Google may be returning the same waypoint_order as input; may need more detailed edge function logging or a direct DB check immediately after an optimize press.
  2. Test CloudPRNT end-to-end with physical printer

### Mar 16, 2026 (session 27) — Route optimization fix + RCC map visualization

- **`optimize-route` v12 — geographic-extremes algorithm (commit `f242eda`):** Replaced the fixed-endpoint approach (pin stop #1 as origin, last stop as destination by stop_number order) with a geographic-extremes method. Northernmost and southernmost stops (by actual latitude) become the natural endpoints. Two Google API calls are made (N→S and S→N direction), and the shorter total road distance wins. Also extracted a shared `callGoogle()` helper for cleaner code. Fixes U-shaped routes that occurred when stop_number endpoints happened to be in the same geographic area (e.g., two north Berkeley stops as start/end forcing a south-sweep-and-return). v11 (circular trick) was also tried but produced same ordering in some cases; v12 geographic approach is more reliable.

- **RCC map — separate pickup/delivery polylines (commit `f242eda`):** The RCC map now draws pickups and deliveries as two distinct polylines (solid for pickups, dashed for deliveries), each sorted by their own `stop_number`. Previously all stops were merged into one combined polyline which always looked tangled regardless of route quality. Pin deduplication preserved — same-address stops (customer with both pickup and delivery) show one pin with a "📦 pickup + 🏠 delivery" popup note.

- **RCC — reassignment badge via DB (commits `f237ef9`, `95f2917`):** Added `moved_from_route_id` UUID column (FK, ON DELETE SET NULL) to `route_stops`. Badge data now persists in the DB instead of `localStorage` — consistent across all browsers and users. Logic: set on first drag to a different route; cleared if stop is moved back to its original route. Badge shows the route COLOR + name it came from. SELECT queries updated to fetch `moved_from_route_id` in both `rccToggleRoute` and `rccRefreshRoute`.

- **RCC — ghost stops filtered (commit `9233254`):** Added `'skipped'` to the order status exclusion filter in 3 places. Deleted 20 dangling `route_stops` rows whose linked orders had status `skipped` (cancelled orders that weren't cleaned up). Renumbered remaining stops sequentially using `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY route_id ORDER BY stop_number)`. Fixed misassigned stop (Alex Rivera was on Oakland PM, moved to Berkeley PM).

- **Orders table — Pickup/Delivery Route sort fixed (commit `257a043`):** Added missing `case 'pickup_run_id'` and `case 'delivery_run_id'` branches to the sort switch in `renderOrders()`. Now sorts alphabetically by route name (lowercased) from the joined `pickup_run`/`delivery_run` objects.

---

### Mar 16, 2026 (session 26) — RCC polish: AM/PM toggle, header swap, drag-and-drop fix

- **AM/PM pill toggle added to chip strip (commit `4ee5217`):** Small segmented control rendered at the left edge of `#rcc-chips`. State stored in `_rccSlot` (`'AM'|'PM'`). Auto-selects based on current hour (`< 12 → AM`) on first `loadDailyRuns()` call; persists user choice when navigating between dates. `rccRenderChips()` filters `_dsTemplates` by slot before rendering chips: AM = `window_start < 12`, PM = `window_start >= 12`. Templates with no `window_start` always show. `rccSetSlot(slot)` closes any currently-open columns whose routes belong to the other time window, then re-renders everything.

- **Column header layout swapped:** Route template name is now the large primary heading; driver name sits underneath as the gray subtitle. Previously it was the other way around. Drop hint also updated to say the route name instead of driver name.

- **Drag-and-drop reassignment fixed:** The previous `ondragleave="this.classList.remove('rcc-drop-over')"` inline handler fired every time the cursor entered a child element (a stop card, text, etc.), making the column lose its drop highlight and breaking the visual feedback. Fixed by replacing with `rccDragLeave(event)` which checks `event.currentTarget.contains(event.relatedTarget)` before removing the class. Also added `ondragover`/`ondrop` directly on `.rcc-body` (scrollable card area) so drops work even when the cursor is over a card rather than empty column space. Added `event.stopPropagation()` to both `rccDragOver` and `rccDrop` to prevent double-firing when both `.rcc-col` and its child `.rcc-body` handle the same event.

- **QA catch:** `rccDrop` was using `event.currentTarget` to clear `.rcc-drop-over`, but `currentTarget` could be `.rcc-body` after the body handler was added. Fixed with `event.currentTarget.closest('.rcc-col') || event.currentTarget`.

---

### Mar 16, 2026 (session 24) — Dynamic route re-optimization system

- **`optimize-route` Edge Function v10 deployed:** Enhanced to accept optional `driver_lat`/`driver_lng` in request body. Separates stops into `done` (complete/failed/skipped) and `pending` per group (pickups and deliveries handled independently). Only pending stops are passed to Google Maps for re-ordering. Done stops keep their original `stop_number` values; pending stops are renumbered starting from `maxDone+1`. When driver GPS provided: driver position is origin, last pending stop is fixed destination, all other pending stops are reorderable waypoints. When no GPS: first pending stop is fixed origin, last is fixed destination, middle stops are reorderable. Returns `driver_origin_used: boolean`.

- **Admin — `autoOptimizeRoute(routeId)` helper added:** Silent fire-and-forget function. Calls `optimize-route` edge function with no spinner, no toast. If the user currently has the optimized route open in the Order Schedule view, it refreshes automatically. Hooked into **4 trigger points**: `opSaveRouteAndSlot` (schedule picker), new order creation (`saveOrder`), and `confirmMoveStop` (both source and destination routes).

- **Driver app — GPS position always current:** Added `_driverLat` / `_driverLng` module-level variables. Updated on *every* `watchPosition` callback fix — *before* the 12-second DB-write throttle check. Ensures re-optimization always has a fresh position even between DB writes.

- **Driver app — `reoptimizeRoute(routeId)` added:** Async function called automatically (non-blocking) after `completeStop`, `failStop`, and `skipStop`. Sends current driver GPS to `optimize-route` edge function. On success: re-fetches `stop_number` values from DB, patches `allStops` in-place, re-sorts by stop_number, and re-renders the home screen. Silent fail — driver sees their current stop list unchanged if optimization fails or network is slow. Skipped for `completeStop` when route status is already `complete` (no pending stops to re-order).

- **QA blast-radius fixes:** Found and fixed two additional places that insert route stops without triggering optimization — new order creation and `confirmMoveStop`. All 4 stop-insertion paths now consistently trigger `autoOptimizeRoute`.

- **Commit:** `fd781d8`

- **Next session priorities:**
  1. Test CloudPRNT end-to-end with physical printer on-site
  2. Route picker fine-tuning (backlog)
  3. Xero accounting sync (backlog)

---

### Mar 16, 2026 (session 23) — Settings reorganization, New Order date bug fix

- **Settings nav reorganized (commit `b795b92`):** "Timezone" sidebar nav item renamed to **"Printer"** with a printer icon — shows only the Receipt Printer configuration card (server URL, token, Save, Test Print). Business Timezone moved into a new **Settings** tab inside the Routes/Maps page (alongside existing Zones and Route Templates tabs). The topbar CTA button hides itself on the Settings tab since there's no relevant action. `renderMapsSettingsTab()` added to render the timezone card on demand; `setMapsTab()` updated to handle the new tab.

- **Safe git commit helper (commit `c82e3b2`):** Created `.git-commit.sh` at repo root — the correct bindfs FUSE workaround. Seeds a temp index with `git read-tree HEAD` before adding changed files, guaranteeing the full tree is included in every commit. Prevents the sparse-tree bug that caused the site outage. **Always use this script for commits on this machine.** Usage: `./.git-commit.sh "message" file1 file2 ...`

- **Bug fix — New Order pickup date off by one day for evening slots (commit `ef58ceb`):** When admin picked e.g. 6–8pm on Mon Mar 16 (PT), `buildSlots()` stored the window as `2026-03-17T01:00Z` (UTC). Then `selectNoSlot()` was extracting the date via `startIso.split('T')[0]` → `'2026-03-17'`, so the pickup summary showed "Tue Mar 17" and `initDeliverySection()` was seeded with the wrong date (delivery landed one extra day late). Fix: `selectNoDay()` now passes the locally-selected `iso` as an explicit 5th argument to `selectNoSlot()`, which uses it directly for display and delivery calculation. UTC timestamps stored in DB are still correct — only the display and delivery seeding were affected.

- **Pickup Failed (Auto) explained:** `auto_fail_expired_orders()` pg_cron function (every 30 min) marks `scheduled` orders as `pickup_failed` with `cancelled_by = 'system'` if `GREATEST(order.pickup_window_end, route.window_end) + 2 hours` has passed (updated session 34 — previously only used order slot, now also considers route operational window). Badge shows "(Auto)" when `cancelled_by = 'system'`. Reschedule from Issues tab resets back to `scheduled`.

- **Next session priorities:**
  1. Test CloudPRNT end-to-end with physical printer on-site (setup guide in `TSP654II-CloudPRNT-Setup.md`)
  2. Route picker fine-tuning (backlog)
  3. Xero accounting sync (backlog)

### Mar 16, 2026 (session 22) — CloudPRNT integration (Star TSP654II)

- **`print_jobs` table created** (migration `cloudprnt_print_jobs`): `id`, `printer_token`, `order_id` (FK → orders, ON DELETE SET NULL), `content` (Star Markup text), `status` (pending → claimed → done), `created_at`, `claimed_at`, `completed_at`. Composite index on `(printer_token, status, created_at)` for fast polling. RLS: `admin_all_print_jobs` (authenticated + `is_admin()`); Edge Function uses service_role (bypasses RLS).

- **`settings.printer_token` column added**: Nullable TEXT. Stores the printer's CloudPRNT token. Loaded into `BIZ_PRINTER_TOKEN` global at startup alongside timezone.

- **`cloudprnt` Edge Function deployed** (JWT off — public, printer has no auth token): Handles full CloudPRNT handshake: GET `?ctoken=TOKEN` → `{ jobReady: true/false, mediaTypes: ["text/vnd.star.markup"] }`. POST with form body → returns pending job's Star Markup content and marks it `claimed`. POST with `jobDone=true` → marks it `done`. Uses service_role key to read/update `print_jobs`.

- **Admin → Settings → Receipt Printer card added**: Displays the CloudPRNT server URL with a Copy button. Printer token input (monospace, placeholder `AA-BB-CC-DD-EE-FF`). Save button + "✓ Printer connected" badge when token is set. **🖨 Test Print** button queues a test job with basic Star Markup (business name, "TEST PRINT", timestamp).

- **`buildStarMarkup(data)` function**: Converts the same data shape as `_openReceiptWindow()` into Star Document Markup Language (SDM) for the TSP654II. Sections: centered business header (size 2:2), customer name (size 2:1), address, order number + weight, pickup/delivery schedule, stop/route, add-ons, invoice line items (38-char label + 8-char right-aligned amount), subtotal/fees/credits, amount due (size 1:2), Code128 barcode, footer. XML-safe via `_escXml()`.

- **`queueCloudPRNTJob(data)` function**: Inserts a `print_jobs` row with the Star Markup. Shows "✓ Sent to printer" toast on success.

- **Both print paths updated**: `printBagTag()` (order panel + kanban Reprint) and `_autoPrintIntake()` (intake save → processing) now check `BIZ_PRINTER_TOKEN`. When set: skip popup, queue CloudPRNT job. When unset: original browser popup behavior unchanged.

- **Commits this session:** `bb7255a` (CloudPRNT integration), `202e80b` (tree repair — see below)

- **⚠ Site outage + fix (commit `202e80b`):**
  - **Root cause:** The bindfs FUSE git workaround was seeding a *temp index from scratch* instead of from `HEAD`. Every docs-only commit after `a19d206` deployed a Vercel repo containing only the changed file (e.g., just `PROJECT-NOTES.md`). No `admin-dashboard/`, `customer-app/`, `driver-app/`, or `vercel.json` → 404 on all routes. Affected commits: `a19d206`, `4e62cf9`, `aecf9e3`.
  - **Fix:** Rebuilt full tree from `d928bd0` (last good commit) using `git read-tree d928bd0` to seed the temp index, then layered on current `admin-dashboard/index.html`, `PROJECT-NOTES.md`, and `TSP654II-CloudPRNT-Setup.md`. Committed as `202e80b`, Vercel deployed immediately.
  - **Prevention:** Created `.git-commit.sh` helper script at repo root. Uses `git read-tree HEAD` to seed temp index before adding any files — guarantees full tree on every commit. **Always use this script for future commits on this machine.**

- **Next session priorities:**
  1. Test CloudPRNT end-to-end with physical printer (David picking up TSP654II tonight — setup guide in `TSP654II-CloudPRNT-Setup.md`)
  2. Route picker fine-tuning (backlog)
  3. Xero accounting sync (backlog)

### Mar 16, 2026 (session 21) — Driver app phone OTP login

- **Driver app: Magic Link replaced with Phone Code SMS OTP (commit `a743a3b`):** The "Magic Link" auth tab (email → sign-in link) has been removed and replaced with a "Phone Code" tab. Two-step flow: driver enters mobile number → receives SMS code → enters 6-digit code. E.164 normalisation handles any 10-digit US number format. Functions added: `doDriverPhoneOTP()`, `doDriverOTPVerify()`, `resendDriverOTP()`, `resetDriverPhone()`. `switchAuthTab()` updated from `'magic'` to `'phone'`. Load-timeout handler updated to also reset the phone OTP panel if it fires mid-verification.

- **Driver phone account linking (commit `a743a3b`):** `link_phone_auth_driver` Postgres SECURITY DEFINER function (applied session 20) is called from `loadDriverData()` when `currentUser.phone` is set. It finds the existing driver record by matching last 10 phone digits in `profiles` (where `role = 'driver'`), re-points `drivers.profile_id` to the new phone-auth UUID, and patches the new profile row with the driver's real name/email. On first phone login, the driver's full history and route assignments transfer automatically. `MULTIPLE_MATCHES` (two drivers share a number) shows a toast and auto-signs out.

- **Note for David:** Drivers must have a phone number stored in their profile for account linking to work. When setting up new drivers in the admin, make sure their mobile number is saved to the profile. Existing drivers can be verified in Admin → Team → Drivers.

- **Commits this session:** `a743a3b` (driver phone OTP)

### Mar 16, 2026 (session 21b) — Security audit + full RLS hardening

- **Full security audit run across all 3 apps + database.** No hardcoded Twilio/SendGrid/Stripe secret keys found in app files. XSS in SMS inbox is correctly handled. All 34 tables have RLS enabled. Stripe secret key absent (publishable key only). Twilio/SendGrid credentials in Supabase Secrets only.

- **27 dangerous RLS policies removed across 18 tables** (migrations `rls_security_hardening` + `rls_security_hardening_services_v2`). The two critical ones — `cpm_anon_all` (payment method data) and `anon_all_sms_messages` (full SMS history) — are gone. All tables now require authentication for any write access. Key policy changes:
  - `customer_payment_methods`: `cpm_anon_all` dropped
  - `sms_messages`: `anon_all_sms_messages` dropped
  - `customers`, `orders`, `routes`, `route_stops`, `addresses`, `profiles`, `drivers`: all anon read/write blanket policies dropped; scoped per-user + admin policies retained
  - `driver_locations`: open-to-anyone upsert replaced with driver-scoped insert/update + authenticated read
  - `discounts`, `settings`: ALL-for-public replaced with SELECT-only for public
  - `message_templates`, `route_driver_overrides`, `route_templates`, `preferences`, `driver_messages`, `notifications`, `cs_issues`, `conversations`, `launderers`, `racks`, `order_items`, `subscriptions`, `customer_transactions`, `services`, `service_fees`, `service_categories`: all anon write policies dropped

- **Google Maps API key** — David restricted to `*.washroute.vercel.app/*` referrer in GCP Console on 2026-03-16. ✅ Done.

### Mar 16, 2026 (session 20) — UX fixes, route badges, Delivered tab, hash routing, OTP fix

- **UX fixes — customer app (commit `56529f6`):** Orders screen back button now navigates to Home (not Account, which was a dead end). Step 2 CTA changed from "Looks good →" to "Next →" (clearer intent).

- **Delivered tab added to admin Orders page (commit `56529f6`):** New "Delivered" filter tab shows orders delivered in the **last 24 hours only** (`actual_delivery_at || delivery_window_start >= now()-24h`). Cancelled orders are fully archived — never shown in any tab. Tab count badge updates live with the same 24h filter.

- **Route-status badges added to Routes > Schedule grid (commit `9c714ae`):** 🔒 (all stops complete) and amber pulsing dot (in-progress) badges now appear in the weekly schedule grid on the Routes page, matching what was already on the Drivers > Schedule grid. Pre-fetched via a single query at render time when `schedWeekOffset === 0`.

- **URL hash sub-page persistence (commit `9546d02`):** Admin dashboard now writes the active sub-tab to the URL hash when navigating. On browser refresh, both the page and sub-tab are restored. Supported states: `#orders/schedule`, `#orders/in_process`, `#orders/delivered`, `#orders/issues`, `#orders/ready`, `#orders/scheduled`, `#maps/zones`, `#maps/routes`, `#team/members`, `#team/permissions`, `#routes/templates`. Restore logic pre-sets `currentOrderFilter` before `showPage()` so `loadOrders()` fetches the correct dataset, then corrects the hash a second time after `switchOrdersView()` would otherwise overwrite it to `#orders/orders`.

- **Twilio OTP fix (manual config — no code change):** Customer app phone login was failing with Twilio error 20003 (auth failure). Root cause: the Supabase Auth phone provider stores its own copy of the Twilio Auth Token, separate from Supabase Secrets. When the token was rotated in session 8, only Supabase Secrets was updated — not the Auth provider setting. Fixed by David updating the token at Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Phone.

- **Commits this session:** `9c714ae` (route badges), `56529f6` (UX + Delivered tab), `e3b8ee2` (Delivered tab 24h scope), `9546d02` (hash routing)

### Mar 16, 2026 (session 19) — Sign-out fix, turnaround enforcement, smart driver reassignment, QA

- **Bug fix — Sign-out button stuck as "Signing out…" (commit `8882c52`):**
  After a sign-in/sign-out cycle in the same browser session, the Account tab button remained disabled and showed "Signing out…" permanently. Root cause: the DOM state from the previous session was never reset. `loadAccount()` now unconditionally resets `.signout-btn` to `{disabled:false, textContent:'Sign Out'}` on every visit.

- **Bug fix — Delivery window engine didn't respect route-template turnaround (commits `f213c99`, `f859f38`):**
  A customer could book a PM pickup (e.g. 8–10 PM) with AM delivery the next morning (7–9 AM) despite a 1-day turnaround on the Berkeley PM route template. Root cause was three compounding gaps: (1) window objects lacked a `templateStartMins` field so the filter had no way to identify AM vs PM routes; (2) the delivery window filter only ran when `deliveryDate === pickupDate` (same calendar date), completely missing next-day PM → next-morning AM scenarios; (3) `draft.deliveryWindow` silently fell back to the pickup window label, masking the problem in the UI. Fixed with a layered approach:
  - `templateStartMins` added to all window objects in `computeSubWindows()`.
  - `draft._earliestDeliveryWindowMins` tracks the minimum valid delivery start (in minutes) for the first eligible delivery date.
  - Delivery window render filter (`_renderSchedWindowOpts`) now checks `isFirstEligibleDate` against `draft._deliveryOptions[0]` and filters by `startMins >= minMins`.
  - Auto-select logic in `_updateSchedDelivery()` and `selectSchedDeliveryDate()` both pick the first window that clears the floor.
  - Final guard in `placeOrder()` blocks submission if the resolved window is still too early.
  - `_updateSchedWindowDisplay` and `buildConfirmSummary` no longer fall back to the pickup window label — show "—" if no delivery window is set.

- **Feature — Admin Drivers > Schedule: smart reassignment rules (commit `f461017`):**
  Clicking a driver chip on today's column now runs a two-step check before allowing reassignment:
  - Grid badges: 🔒 for fully-complete routes, amber pulsing dot for in-progress routes (pre-fetched when rendering the schedule grid).
  - Popover banner: "Route in progress — only the N remaining stops will be reassigned" or "Route complete — no stops to reassign" shown asynchronously after popover opens.
  - `assignDriverOverride()` uses `popoverCtx.routeStatus` (fetched by `openDriverPopover`) to: skip stop propagation if route is complete; or filter `route_stops` by `status IN ('pending', 'en_route')` if partially done. Completed/skipped/failed stops stay attributed to the driver who did them.
  - `route_driver_schedule` is always updated (it's weekly/recurring), but the stop-level propagation is status-aware.

- **QA fix — `toast()` called with wrong second argument in `placeOrder()` (commit `72f17b8`):**
  Three delivery validation toasts in `placeOrder()` used `toast(msg, 'error')`. The `toast()` function signature is `(msg, duration)` — passing `'error'` as duration resulted in `setTimeout(fn, NaN)` → toast disappeared instantly (NaN → 0ms) with no error styling. Fixed all three to `showToast(msg, 'error')`. Two were pre-existing (same-day guard and turnaround check from session 18); one was from the new non-same-day guard added this session.

- **Commits:** `8882c52` (sign-out fix), `f213c99` + `f859f38` (turnaround enforcement), `f461017` (smart reassignment), `72f17b8` (QA: toast fix)

### Mar 16, 2026 (session 18) — Hotfixes: same-day delivery window + email delivery time

- **Bug: Same-day delivery was saving the pickup window as the delivery window (commit `825b3c7`):**
  `placeOrder()` used `draft.deliveryWindow || pw` to resolve the delivery window. When `draft.deliveryWindow` was null at submission time (edge case where same-day toggle state and draft window became out of sync), it fell back to `pw` (the pickup window), producing an impossible same-delivery-as-pickup order. Order #101 was saved with `pickup_window_start = delivery_window_start = 16:00 UTC (9am PDT)` and `is_same_day = true`.

- **Fix — `_effectiveDW` resolution in `placeOrder()`:** Replaced the single-line `|| pw` fallback with a proper two-path resolver:
  - Same-day: `draft.deliveryWindow → draft._sameDayWindows[0]` — never falls back to `pw`
  - Standard: `draft.deliveryWindow → null` (no explicit window; date-only delivery)

- **Added two turnaround guards in `placeOrder()` (before the DB INSERT):**
  1. **Turnaround check** — if same-day order and resolved `delivStartMs <= pickupEndMs`, blocks with toast: "Delivery time must be after your pickup window."
  2. **Hard stop** — if `isSameDay=true` but no delivery window could be resolved at all, blocks with toast explaining to choose a different pickup time.

- **Bug: Confirmation email showed delivery date only, no time (commit `825b3c7`):**
  The `'Est. Delivery'` row in the booking confirmation email used `_fmtD(deliveryDate)` (date only). Pickup row correctly used `pw.label`. Fixed to use `_effectiveDW.label` (the same resolved delivery window used for the order) — email now shows e.g. "Monday, March 16 · 8pm – 10pm".

### Mar 16, 2026 (session 17) — Hotfix: Double Wash overriding base bag price

- **Bug: Double Wash was becoming the default service in customer app (commit `41f6b97`):**
  When Double Wash was added to the `services` table in session 16, it was inserted with `sort_order=0` — lower than Wash & Fold's `sort_order=1`. The customer app sets `defaultService = allServices[0]` (the first row returned), so Double Wash ($15/bag) was being used as the base price instead of Wash & Fold ($59/bag). Pricing screen showed "1 bag × $15.00" and confirmed order summary showed "Double Wash × 1 bag $15.00" — a $44/bag undercharge per order.

- **Fix — code:** Changed `defaultService = allServices[0]` to `defaultService = allServices.find(s => !s.is_addon) || null` in `customer-app/index.html`. This makes the selection immune to sort order changes — addon services can never become the default service regardless of their `sort_order`.

- **Fix — DB:** Updated Double Wash `sort_order` from 0 → 5 (slots it after Oxi at 3, before Air Dry at 7). Corrected order is now: Wash & Fold (1), Vinegar (2), Oxi (3), Shirt Service (4), Double Wash (5), Air Dry (7).

- **Admin unaffected:** Admin dashboard never used `defaultService` — it always looks up service by `service_id` on existing orders.

### Mar 15, 2026 (session 16) — Double Wash pricing + SMS automation Phase 1

- **Double Wash preference + addon service added to DB (no code change needed):**
  - New row in `preferences` table (`id: 523db29c`): name="Double Wash", category="Delivery", sort_order=4, options=[No (default, $0), Yes ($15)].
  - New row in `services` table (`id: 3de1c270`): name="Double Wash", base_price=$15.00, pricing_type="per_bag", is_addon=true, linked_preference_id → the new preference.
  - Both apps pick it up automatically on next load. Customer app shows "+$15.00/bag" toggle chip between Oxi and the next pref. Admin processing shows it in the intake breakdown.

- **SMS automation Phase 1 — `twilio-webhook` v14 deployed:**
  Four inbound keyword handlers are now live. All auto-replies are logged to `sms_messages` (direction='outbound') so they appear in the admin SMS inbox.

  | Keyword | Action |
  |---|---|
  | `PICKUP` | Books the customer's next pickup using last order as template (zone, address, bags). Blocks duplicate if active order exists. Replies with order # + pickup date/window. |
  | `STATUS` / `ORDER` / `ETA` / `WHERE` / `UPDATE` / `TRACK` + fuzzy phrases | Replies with real-time order status + relevant date. Covers all active statuses (scheduled, picked_up, processing, ready_for_delivery, on_hold, pickup_failed). No active order → nudges to reply PICKUP. |
  | `SKIP` | Skips next scheduled pickup, sets cancelled_by='customer', sends skip confirmation template. Now also logs outbound confirmation to admin inbox (was missing before). |
  | `HELP` / `HI` / `HELLO` / `HEY` | Sends command menu listing PICKUP, STATUS, SKIP. |
  | Anything else | Logged to admin inbox, no reply. |

  - PICKUP handler details: fetches last delivered order → copies zone_id, address IDs, bag count, service_id → finds next valid route day in PT using route_templates.schedule_days → creates order with source='sms' → DB trigger auto-assigns route + stops → confirms via TwiML reply.
  - PT timezone handled dynamically via `getPtOffsetHours()` (works for both PST/PDT).
  - STATUS query also nudges "Reply PICKUP to book" when no active order found.
  - SKIP handler fixed to set `cancelled_by: 'customer'` (was missing) and now logs outbound confirmation.

### Mar 15, 2026 (session 11) — Admin order panel: same-day toggle + delivery address checkbox

- **Same-day service toggle (commit `a5915a4`):** ⚡ checkbox added inline with the Delivery section header in the admin Order panel Schedule tab. On panel open, same-day is auto-detected by comparing `pickup_window_start` and `delivery_window_start` date substrings. When checked, adds a $10 surcharge to the estimate (fee amount looked up from `service_fees` with category `Surcharge` + name containing "same"). `opToggleSameDay()` sets `opIsSameDay` and calls `opRecalcEstimate()`.

- **Delivery address hidden behind checkbox (commit `a5915a4`):** Replaced the always-visible "Delivery Address" section with a "Different delivery address" checkbox. The address picker is hidden by default and only revealed when checked. On panel open, the checkbox auto-checks if `delivery_address_id` exists and differs from `pickup_address_id`. Unchecking calls `opToggleDiffDeliveryAddr(false)` which nulls `delivery_address_id` in DB — the system then falls back to the pickup address. Reduces risk of accidental address changes.

- **`opSaveDetails()` updated to persist same-day surcharge:** When the same-day toggle is on, saves `type: 'same_day_surcharge'` line item (consistent with the admin order creation flow type) and includes the surcharge in `total_amount`. Billing tab Charge button is also refreshed via `opPopulateBilling(o)` after save so the label stays in sync.

- **Same-day toggle auto-shifts delivery window date:** When admin checks ⚡ Same-day, `opToggleSameDay()` now automatically shifts `delivery_window_start`/`delivery_window_end` to the same local calendar date as the pickup (keeping the same time-of-day — e.g. 6pm stays 6pm but moves from Mar 17 → Mar 16). Saved to DB immediately, display refreshes. Unchecking restores the original delivery window from `_opPreSameDayDeliveryStart/End`. Auto-detection on panel open now uses `en-CA` locale in `BIZ_TZ` for accurate local date comparison. Admin still needs to verify/update the delivery route via Edit (route instances are date-specific).

- **Next session priorities:**
  1. Add `price_mod` for Double Wash and remaining add-on prefs
  2. Receipt printing — thermal 80mm bag tag (mockup at `receipt-mockup.html`)
  3. ~~Twilio A2P 10DLC registration~~ ✅ Approved 2026-03-16

### Mar 15, 2026 (session 10) — Preference UX overhaul: checkboxes throughout + order→account sync

- **Add-on preferences as checkboxes — order flow (commits `58917f7`):** Yes/No preference groups (Oxi, Vinegar, Double Wash, etc.) are now detected automatically via `_isAddonPref()` helper (exactly 2 options, one `is_default`). Instead of Yes/No buttons, these render as tappable checkbox rows under an "Optional Add-ons" heading. Regular multi-option prefs (Wash temp, Dry temp) still show the button grid. CSS classes: `.order-addon-section`, `.order-addon-row`, `.order-addon-row.checked`, `.order-addon-check`.

- **Add-on preferences as chips — admin intake panel (commit `58917f7`):** Same `_isIntakeAddon` detection applied to `renderIntakePanel()`. Add-ons render as a compact "Customer Add-ons" chip row — togglable on/off. Regular prefs keep full button groups. `selectProcAddon()` updated to toggle: if tapping the already-selected active option, reverts to the default option (effectively unchecking).

- **Confirm page pricing accuracy (commits `308f9d3`, `b0ba5a1`):** Fixed two issues on the booking confirmation screen:
  1. Add-on rows were displaying the option label ("Yes") instead of the preference group name ("Vinegar Rinse"). Fixed by looking up `globalPrefs.find(g => g.id === groupId)?.name`.
  2. Add-on fees were flat (not multiplied by bag count), mismatching the processing queue logic. Fixed: `priceMod × bags` in both `updateEstimate()` and `buildConfirmSummary()`.

- **Confirm page preferences section redesigned (commit `fe4a84d`):** Preferences now show as a dedicated card with one row per selected preference (name + chosen option label, price note for paid add-ons). Edit → button navigates back to the preferences step (`goOrderStep(2)`).

- **Account > Laundry Preferences redesigned to match order flow (commit `9cdad69`):** Replaced the old `<select>` dropdown UI with the same button grid + checkbox layout used in the order flow. Opening the panel calls `openPrefsSubPanel()` which re-initialises `acctPrefs` from saved data each time (no stale state). `selectAcctPref()` / `toggleAcctAddon()` handle interactions. Save button now shows "Saving…" and disables during the Supabase write.

- **Order preference changes sync back to Laundry Preferences (commit `9cdad69`):** `selectOrderPref()` and `toggleOrderAddon()` now call `_syncOrderPrefsToAccount()` — a fire-and-forget async function that converts `draft.prefs` to `{ groupId: optionId }` format and writes it to `customers.preferences`. This means a customer who changes their prefs during booking automatically has their saved account prefs updated without any extra step.

- **Next session priorities:**
  1. Add `price_mod` for Double Wash and remaining add-on prefs
  2. Receipt printing — thermal 80mm bag tag (mockup at `receipt-mockup.html`)
  3. ~~Twilio A2P 10DLC registration~~ ✅ Approved 2026-03-16

### Mar 15, 2026 (session 9) — Same-day toggle confirmed, sign-out fix, estimate total overhaul

- **Same-day toggle confirmed working end-to-end:** Toggle now appears correctly when 7am–9am is auto-selected after date pick. Root fix from session 8 (`04e18e9`) was correct — added a `try/catch` wrapper and diagnostic logging (`8616949`) to catch any silent exception in the async chain, which resolved the issue. Diagnostic logs cleaned up in the same session (`customer-app/index.html` — no separate commit, bundled with sign-out fix).

- **Sign-out button stuck on "Signing out…" (commit `8ae1ef1`):** `db.auth.signOut()` makes a network call to revoke the Supabase token and can hang indefinitely — the Promise never settles, the button stays disabled forever. Fixed by adding a 1.5s `setTimeout` force-logout fallback: clears local auth state (`appReady`, `currentUser`, `currentProfile`, `currentCustomer`, `currentCards`), hides bottom nav, and navigates to auth screen. If the Supabase call resolves before 1.5s, the timer is cleared. Error path also now logs out locally instead of just re-enabling the button.

- **Estimate total now shows all charges (commits `41d0144`, `59115bf`):** The bag count step estimate and the confirm order page total were only showing the per-bag base price. Two root causes fixed:
  1. **`loadServices()` updated** to fetch `service_fees` table (`show_in_app=true`) in parallel with services and preferences — stored in new global `allServiceFees[]`.
  2. **`updateEstimate()` and `buildConfirmSummary()` updated** to include: delivery/pickup fees from `service_fees` (category whitelist: `'Delivery'` or `'Pickup'`), add-on preference charges, and same-day surcharge if toggled on. Estimate note now shows a breakdown, e.g. "2 bags × $29.50 · add-ons +$6.00 · Delivery Fee +$9.95 · ⚡ Same-day +$10.00", plus "Up to 25 lbs/bag · Overages billed at processing".
  3. **Route fee filter uses category whitelist** (not name exclusion) so Missed Pickup Fee ($15) and Refer-a-Friend Credit ($10) never appear in estimates.

- **Preference add-on prices added to DB (SQL migration, session 9):** The `preferences` table stores options as a JSONB array. Options had no `price_mod` field, so add-ons always contributed $0 to the estimate. Added `"price_mod": 3.00` to the "Yes" option for both "Add Vinegar?" and "Add Oxi?" via targeted `jsonb_agg` + `CASE WHEN` SQL. Verified with a SELECT confirming both options now carry the correct price mod. Double Wash and other add-on prices deferred to a future session.

- **Next session:** Add `price_mod` for Double Wash and remaining add-ons.

---

### Mar 15, 2026 (session 8) — Customer app UX fixes, security hardening, same-day toggle bug fix

- **SendGrid receipts confirmed working:** Verified `SENDGRID_API_KEY` was already set in Supabase Secrets (shared with `send-email` function). Live test via browser console returned `{ok: true, sent_to: 'dmacquart@gmail.com'}`. No changes needed.

- **Order cards now show pickup date (commits `cf809a8`, `ab66022`):** Order cards in My Orders were displaying the booking date (`created_at`) instead of the pickup date. Fixed by using `pickup_window_start` (the correct column — `pickup_date` doesn't exist). Order detail "Placed [date]" still correctly shows `created_at`. Also added `skipped` and `pickup_failed` to `PAST_STATUSES` so those orders correctly appear in the Past tab (not Current).

- **Delivery address removed from customer app (commits `f65b95a`, `63cee3f`):** Removed the delivery address picker and same-address checkbox from the booking flow and Edit Order modal entirely. In 99%+ of cases delivery = pickup address. If admin sets a different delivery address, the customer now sees a read-only note: "Updated by your service team · SMS us to change." `saveEditOrder()` preserves the admin-set delivery address via `window._editDeliveryAddressId`.

- **Compact display fixes (commit `b16697a`):** Removed state abbreviation from `fmtAddrOneLiner()` (all customers are in CA). Replaced `fmtSlot()` with a compact version — e.g., "7–9am" instead of "7:00 AM – 9:00 AM". Both prevent line breaks in order detail rows.

- **Security hardening — Twilio credentials & test endpoint:**
  - `send-sms` and `notify-on-my-way` edge functions had a hardcoded Twilio auth token as a fallback (`|| 'cdfc2502...'`). Token was rotated in Twilio Console. Both functions redeployed to read from Supabase Secrets (`TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`) with no hardcoded fallback. Both return 500 if secrets are missing.
  - `create-test-user` edge function was a publicly accessible endpoint (no auth) that could create admin-role users. Neutralized — now always returns 404.
  - Stripe publishable key and Supabase anon key in client code are safe by design (confirmed).

- **Same-day toggle bug fixed (commit `04e18e9`):** Toggle never appeared when picking an AM slot via date selection. Root cause: `selectSchedPickupDate()` was missing the `_checkSameDayAvailable()` call after auto-selecting the first window on date change. The check existed in `renderSchedCard` (initial load) and `selectSchedWindow` (manual window tap) but not in the date-selection path. Fixed by adding the full same-day check block to `selectSchedPickupDate`. Also improved copy: "Want it back tonight?" for same-day bookings today, "Want it back Tuesday evening?" for future date bookings. Delivery display shows "Tonight 🌙" or "Mon, Mar 16 🌙" accordingly.

### Mar 14, 2026 (session 7) — Route picker UX overhaul (friction removal, zone refresh, smart defaults, past-slot guard)

- **Remove '+ Create' friction (commit `f46bede`):** Templates no longer show a "+ Create" label. Zone-matched templates for a date appear as normal selectable routes. When tapped, the route instance is created silently in the background (brief opacity dim). No extra admin step ever required.
- **Zone refresh on address change (commit `b6b65f8`):** When admin changes pickup/delivery address while the route picker is already open, zone detection re-runs immediately and the route list updates in place — no manual page refresh needed. Implemented in `opSaveAddress()`.
- **Always show all zone routes (commit `1b36755`):** Previously, if Berkeley PM had a route instance for a date but Berkeley AM didn't, only Berkeley PM appeared. Now the code always combines existing route instances with eligible un-instantiated templates, so both AM and PM always show for any Mon–Sat date regardless of which instances were pre-created.
- **Delivery auto-selects matching timeframe (commit `1b36755`):** When the delivery picker opens, it auto-selects the route matching the pickup's timeframe. Pass 1: exact name match. Pass 2: same AM/PM suffix (e.g. Oakland AM pickup → Berkeley AM delivery when address was changed). Implemented at end of `opFilterRoutesByDate()`.
- **Past time slots hidden on today's date (commit `1192fbb`):** Admin route picker now filters out slots whose window has already ended when the selected date is today. If all slots are past, shows "All windows for this route have passed today. Choose a future date." instead of showing ghost bookings.
- **QA fix: ghost route guard (commit `f8f52df`):** After saving a pickup, `opSaveRouteAndSlot` pre-fills the delivery picker in the background. The new auto-select logic would have fired and silently inserted orphaned route records. Fixed by guarding auto-select to only run when the delivery picker is visibly open.

### Mar 14, 2026 (session 6) — Orders tab restructure, ready_for_pickup removal, reschedule picker overhaul

- **Issues tab: single descriptive badge (commit `b3b4c16`):**
  - Replaced the redundant "status badge + sub-label" combo in the Issues tab with a single `issueBadge(o)` function.
  - Badge text fully describes the situation: "Skipped by Driver", "Skipped by Admin", "Pickup Failed (Auto)", "Delivery Failed (Auto)", "Payment Failed", "On Hold". No separate sub-label needed.

- **Orders tabs restructured (commit `25cda26`):**
  - Old tabs: Scheduled / Active / Delivered / Issues / Cancelled (5 tabs).
  - New tabs: Scheduled / In Process / Ready / Issues (4 tabs). Delivered, cancelled, and customer-skipped orders are archived — not shown in any tab.
  - `ORDER_FILTER_GROUPS`: `scheduled: ['scheduled']`, `in_process: ['picked_up','processing','folding']`, `ready: ['ready_for_delivery','out_for_delivery']`, `issues: ['pickup_failed','delivery_failed','on_hold']`.

- **Removed `ready_for_pickup` status entirely (commit `e502e07`):**
  - Status was never auto-set by any code path — it was a manual-only intermediate step with no functional purpose.
  - DB migration `remove_ready_for_pickup_status`: dropped and recreated `orders_status_check` constraint without `ready_for_pickup`. `auto_fail_expired_orders()` updated to target only `'scheduled'`.
  - All 18 references removed across admin dashboard and customer app: `STATUS_FLOW` (now `scheduled → picked_up` directly), `STATUS_STYLES`, `canAssign`, `ALL_STATUSES`, `ORDER_FILTER_GROUPS`, Reports labels/colors, customer app CSS/logic.

- **Reschedule fixes — failed orders and delivery validation (commits `9699164`, `d7923f9`):**
  - `opSaveRouteAndSlot()` now resets status to `scheduled` (clears `cancelled_by`) when rescheduling a `pickup_failed`, `delivery_failed`, or `on_hold` order. Previously rescheduling left the order stuck in Issues.
  - Delivery date defaults to pickup+1 if existing delivery is invalid (before pickup); `min` date enforced on the delivery date input.
  - Delivery validation: saving a delivery leg before the pickup window end now shows a toast error and aborts.
  - After saving a pickup, delivery date is automatically advanced and delivery route list refreshed.

- **Route picker zone filtering (commits `f9e3538`, `b233190`):**
  - **Root cause found:** Supabase returns `numeric` lat/lng columns as strings. Passing strings to `db.rpc('get_zones_for_point', ...)` caused a silent PostgREST type-cast failure — `_opPickerZoneIds` stayed empty and all routes showed with no filtering.
  - **Fix 1:** `parseFloat(addr.lat)` / `parseFloat(addr.lng)` before passing to the RPC (applied at both call sites).
  - **Fix 2:** City-name fallback now handles `service_zones` as array or single object from Supabase join (`Array.isArray(zoneRaw) ? zoneRaw[0] : zoneRaw`).
  - **UX tightened:** When customer zone is known, only zone-matched routes are shown in the picker. Other-zone routes are completely hidden (not dimmed). All routes shown as fallback if zone can't be determined.

- **QA pass — 2 bugs found and fixed (commit `9483060`):**
  - **Medium:** `'skipped'` was accidentally dropped from `ORDER_FILTER_GROUPS.issues` in the tab restructure. Driver-skipped and admin-skipped orders were invisible in all tabs. Fixed by adding `'skipped'` back and restoring `cancelled_by !== 'customer'` filter so customer-initiated skips stay archived.
  - **Low:** `delivery_failed` orders were resetting to `'scheduled'` on reschedule, implying a full restart when the laundry is already at the facility. Fixed to reset to `'ready_for_delivery'` instead. `pickup_failed` and `on_hold` still correctly reset to `'scheduled'`.

- **All commits:** `b3b4c16`, `25cda26`, `e502e07`, `9699164`, `d7923f9`, `f9e3538`, `b233190`, `0956d44`, `9483060`

### Mar 14, 2026 (session 5) — Payment indicator polish, cancelled_by system, Issues tab improvements, customer skip button

- **Payment indicator rework (commit `ba5426a`):**
  - Moved paid indicator from right side of Amount column to left side as a `$` badge (easier to spot at a glance).
  - Paid orders: green `$` on the left. Failed: red `PAY FAILED` pill. No payment: blank placeholder to hold layout.
  - Failed payments (`billing_status = 'failed'`) now surface in the Issues tab filter and count badge.

- **`cancelled_by` column — full implementation (migrations + all 3 apps, commit `d884169`):**
  - DB migration `orders_add_cancelled_by`: added `cancelled_by TEXT CHECK (IN ('customer','driver','admin','system'))`, nullable, with partial index on non-null values.
  - DB migration `recurring_trigger_respect_cancelled_by`: updated `trg_create_recurring_order_fn` to fire on `skipped` status **only when `cancelled_by = 'customer'`** — fixes a silent bug where driver/admin skips on recurring orders would have broken the subscription chain.
  - DB migration `auto_fail_set_cancelled_by_system`: `auto_fail_expired_orders()` now stamps `cancelled_by = 'system'` when it fires.
  - **Admin:** `opSkipOrder()` (admin processing customer's request) sets `cancelled_by: 'customer'`. `opSetOrderStatus()` and `setSingleOrderStatus()` set `cancelled_by: 'admin'` for terminal statuses. Added `cancelled_by` to orders SELECT query.
  - **Driver app:** `skipStop()` sets `cancelled_by: 'driver'`. Undo path (`triggerUndo()`) clears it back to `null`.
  - **Customer app:** New "Skip this pickup" button on order detail — visible for recurring orders in skippable statuses. `skipPickup()` sets `status: 'skipped', cancelled_by: 'customer'`.

- **Issues tab improvements (commit `7d7a09e`):**
  - Filter now excludes `cancelled_by = 'customer'` orders (intentional skips, not actionable). Includes `billing_status = 'failed'` orders.
  - `issueLabel(o)` helper renders context under each status badge: who skipped/failed it, auto-fail indicator.
  - `issueActionBtn(o)` helper renders inline action: "Retry charge" for billing failures (calls `charge-order` edge function inline), "Reschedule →" for routing issues.
  - Count badge uses the same logic — no more false positives from customer-skipped orders.

- **Customer skip button (commit `0706362`):**
  - New `<div id="d-skip-section">` in customer app order detail, rendered between edit and cancel sections.
  - Shows "Skip this pickup" only when the order is recurring AND in a skippable pre-pickup status.
  - Confirmation dialog reassures customer their subscription continues. Toast confirms skip.

- **Design decision resolved:** See "Customer-Initiated Skips" section above — `cancelled_by` system is the chosen approach, fully shipped.

- **All known P0–P3 bugs remain resolved.** No new issues opened this session.

- **Commits:** `ba5426a` (payment indicator), `1980b60` (design decision doc), `d884169` (cancelled_by full impl), `7d7a09e` (Issues tab improvements), `0706362` (customer skip button)

### Mar 14, 2026 (session 4) — P3 bug fixes: updated_at trigger + skip-notification copy

- **Bug #6 fixed — `route_stops.updated_at` now auto-refreshes:**
  - Added `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger `trg_route_stops_updated_at` via migration `route_stops_auto_updated_at`.
  - Trigger calls `set_updated_at()` function which sets `NEW.updated_at = now()` on every UPDATE.
  - Previously `updated_at` stayed at row creation time even after driver reassignment, status changes, or DB-level cascade updates. Now it always reflects the last actual change.
  - No conflict with existing triggers: `trg_fill_stop_driver` is BEFORE INSERT only; `trg_sync_order_status` is AFTER UPDATE (fires after ours). Safe.

- **Bug #8 fixed — driver app skip-notification banner (commit `0930719`):**
  - `notified` variable in `renderStopDetail()` was computed as `!!stop.on_my_way_sent_at || isEnRoute`. Since `arrivedAtStop()` sets stop status to `en_route` immediately, `isEnRoute` was always `true` after a skip, causing the banner to show "Customer notified · Safe travels!" even when no SMS was sent.
  - Fix: `notified = !!stop.on_my_way_sent_at` — checks only whether the "On My Way" SMS was actually fired.
  - `alreadySent` (button label) and `currentStopPhase` (phase routing) retain `|| isEnRoute` intentionally — they need to route correctly when a stop is re-opened after a skip.

- **All known P0–P3 bugs from the Mar 14 e2e test are now resolved.** Zero open issues in the Known Issues table.

### Mar 14, 2026 (session 3) — P2 bug fixes: route_stop orphan cleanup

- **Bug #1 + #2 fixed — Route stops now sync to terminal order status:**
  - DB trigger `trg_sync_stops_on_order_terminal` created via migration. Fires AFTER UPDATE on `orders` when status changes to any terminal value.
  - `delivered` → pending/en_route stops → `complete`
  - `cancelled` → pending/en_route stops → `skipped`
  - `pickup_failed` → pickup stops → `failed`, delivery stops → `skipped`
  - `skipped` → pending/en_route stops → `skipped`
  - Hard deletes handled by existing FK CASCADE DELETE (confirmed via schema check).
  - **Backfill ran:** 10 orphaned stops across orders #75, 77, 78, 83, 84, 85 all corrected in a one-time cleanup query. Zero orphaned stops remain.
  - QA confirmed: no circular trigger loops, no blast radius in app code, all cancel paths correctly handled.

- **Bug #5 investigated (price discrepancy) — closed as non-issue:**
  - `saveIntake()` correctly writes `total_amount: bd.total` from `calcProcTotal()`. `saveRacking()` does not touch `total_amount`. The $164.95 vs $139.95 discrepancy on order #84 was a pre-existing test value, not a code bug. Downgraded to P3/monitor.

- **No app code commits this session** — all changes were DB-level (migration + backfill via Supabase MCP).

### Mar 14, 2026 (session 2) — End-to-end system test + bug fixes

- **Full end-to-end test:** Placed a test order (admin → processing pipeline → driver skip). Ran full lifecycle: intake (weight entry) → cleaning → folding → rack (Berkeley) → ready_for_delivery → driver skip. Verified all DB state changes at each step.

- **Processing queue realtime sync (commit `1e35b36`):** Replaced 30s poll with Supabase Realtime subscription + 5-min safety net. Both admin and Laundry Tech views now update instantly when any order moves through the kanban.

- **Customer app fixes (commit `a9344c4`):**
  - Sign-out button now disables with "Signing out…" text while the auth request is in flight (was silent with no feedback on slow connections).
  - `window.toggleSameDay` was missing from the `window.` exposure block — would throw a `ReferenceError` on the pricing panel's same-day checkbox tap. Fixed.

- **Bug #7 fixed — Driver app stop reassignment realtime (commit `7916331`):**
  - Realtime UPDATE handler on `route_stops` now removes the stop from a driver's list if its `driver_id` is changed to someone else. Previously the stop just stayed (stale), meaning two drivers could potentially attempt the same delivery.
  - Also handles the inverse: if a stop is newly assigned to this driver (idx < 0 but `driver_id === currentDriver.id`), triggers a `loadRouteData()` reload so it appears immediately.
  - Toast shown: "This stop was reassigned to another driver."

- **Bug #4 fixed — Order Schedule realtime (commit `7916331`):**
  - `confirmReassignDriver()` had an `if (btn)` guard that silently skipped the `selectRunOnMap()` refresh call when no `.run-toggle-btn` could be found. Removed the guard — `selectRunOnMap` handles a null btn fine.
  - Extended `startRouteStopListener` (the global route_stops subscription) to also call `selectRunOnMap(routeLiveRouteId, ...)` when any stop on the currently displayed route changes. Admin now sees driver skips, completions, and reassignments reflected on the Order Schedule map in real-time (~1–2s).

- **Realtime latency measured:**
  - Admin Orders list tab: ~2 seconds after a driver skip (Supabase Realtime on orders table).
  - Driver app: immediate after own action; realtime from admin changes now instant.

- **Bugs found (not yet fixed):** See Known Issues table. Key ones: route stops not cleaned up on cancel/deliver (P2), processing price discrepancy (P2), `route_stops.updated_at` not updated (P3), "Customer notified" banner after skip-notification (P3).

- **Commits:** `1e35b36` (processing queue realtime), `a9344c4` (customer app sign-out + toggleSameDay), `7916331` (driver stop reassignment + Order Schedule realtime)

### Mar 14, 2026 — Same-day delivery + site-wide QA

- **Full site QA (all 3 apps):** Reviewed admin dashboard, driver app, and customer app end-to-end. Two real issues found and fixed:
  - **HIGH (admin):** Credit deduction on processing intake was fire-and-forget — if the DB write silently failed, customer credits wouldn't be reduced but admin UI showed success. Now `await`ed with an error toast so admins know to fix manually.
  - **MEDIUM (admin):** `last_order_at` cache sync was fire-and-forget. Changed to `.catch()` so failures are logged.
  - All 5 realtime subscriptions confirmed properly guarded. Permissions grid refresh confirmed working. All auth safety timers confirmed in place. No High/Medium issues found in driver or customer apps.

- **Same-day delivery feature (customer app + admin route editor):**
  - Customers on **AM pickup routes** (Berkeley AM, Oakland AM) now see an "⚡ Want it back tonight?" toggle immediately after selecting their pickup window.
  - Eligibility driven by `turnaround_hours` on `route_templates` (AM routes = 9, PM routes = 0 — no same-day for evening pickups). Configurable per route from the admin route editor.
  - When toggled ON: delivery date = same day, delivery window = first qualifying PM slot (e.g. 6–8 PM for a 7–9 AM pickup), +$10 surcharge added. Fee always read from `service_fees` (Same-Day Surcharge row) — never hardcoded.
  - `is_same_day: true` written to orders; surcharge included as `same_day_surcharge` line item.
  - Admin route editor now shows and saves the "Same-day turnaround (hours)" field.
  - Toggle resets cleanly whenever pickup date or window changes. No schema migration needed — `turnaround_hours` column already existed on `route_templates` (was 0/unused).
  - **Timezone math note:** `slotEnd` and `slotStart` are both UTC ISO strings (created via `new Date(local).toISOString()`). The 9-hour UTC addition correctly resolves to the PM slot on the same local date in both winter (UTC−8) and summer (UTC−7).

- **New skills installed (found at session start):** `washroute-changelog`, `washroute-test`, `washroute-migration-review` — all three are now active and being used proactively.

- **Commits:** `751baba` (QA fixes), `6eb9426` (same-day delivery)

### Mar 10, 2026
- **Order status pipeline rework:** New flow is `scheduled → ready_for_pickup → picked_up → processing → ready_for_delivery → out_for_delivery → delivered`. Retired `assembled`; replaced `pickup_missed`/`delivery_missed` with unified `skipped` (sits in Issues tab until manually resolved).
- **Filter tabs rework:** Removed "All" tab from Orders page and customer profile. "Upcoming" renamed to "Scheduled". Default tab is now Scheduled.
- **Cancelled orders:** Hidden from All/Scheduled/Active views. Dedicated greyed-out Cancelled tab added in admin and customer profile.
- **Login stuck bug fixed:** `signInWithPassword` can silently hang on flaky networks. Fixed with `setTimeout` safety net (30s) in both admin and customer app. `Promise.race` does NOT work — don't use it (fires immediately with Supabase auth client).
- **Customer app home:** Removed duplicate "Schedule a Pickup" nudge from empty active orders card.
- **Driver app multi-route support:** Driver can now be assigned multiple routes in a day. Home screen shows one card per route with per-route stats. Stop list groups stops by route under route name headers. Stops render in `stop_number` order (geographic) — the old pickup/delivery section split was removed since stops are prioritized by location, not category.
- **Dummy test data:** 8 customers created (4 Berkeley, 4 Oakland), each with a scheduled order for Wed Mar 11 · 7–9 AM pickup, assigned to Berkeley AM / Oakland AM routes. Delivery routes (also named Berkeley AM / Oakland AM) set for Thu Mar 13 · 12–2 PM. Customer IDs start with `a1000001-`, address IDs with `b1000001-`, route IDs with `c1000000-0000-0000-0001-`.
- **Login hang fix extended:** Diagnosed a second hang point — after `signInWithPassword` resolves, `onAuthStateChange` fires and does a DB fetch that can also silently hang. Added a second 15s safety timer (`profileTimer`) in admin `onAuthStateChange` and a `loadTimer` in driver app `onAuthStateChange` covering `loadDriverData()`. Customer app confirmed safe (built-in 20s self-dismiss). All three apps now fully covered.
- **Driver app `doLogin()` hardened:** Was missing `try/catch` and any safety timer. Added both (30s timer + try/catch), consistent with admin `handleLogin()`.
- **Admin login timeout fix (root cause solved):** When a cached session existed in localStorage, Supabase fired `INITIAL_SESSION` + `TOKEN_REFRESHED` on page load. These background operations raced against the user's manual `signInWithPassword` call and caused the 30s safety timer to fire ("Connection timed out"). Fix: on a fresh tab/window load, clear localStorage before initialising Supabase so there's no cached session to trigger the race. `sessionStorage` is used to distinguish a fresh load (clear localStorage) from a page refresh within the same tab (keep the session). Outcome: no timeout on fresh visits, no logout on refresh. sessionStorage flag set on successful login, cleared on logout.
- **Admin logout-on-refresh fix (round 2):** Supabase v2 can fire `INITIAL_SESSION` with `session = null` when the access token is expired but the refresh token is still valid (e.g. once per hour). The previous code called `showLoginScreen()` immediately on any null session, removing the `sessionStorage` key and flashing the login screen before `TOKEN_REFRESHED` arrived with a fresh token. Fix: `SIGNED_OUT` is the only event that definitively ends a session — show login immediately only for that event. For any other null-session event (`INITIAL_SESSION` null, etc.), start a 2-second fallback timer; if `TOKEN_REFRESHED` arrives with a valid session first, the timer is cancelled and the app shows normally. Result: no login-screen flash on token refresh, and users stay logged in across refreshes.

### Mar 13, 2026 (session 3) — Role-based access permissions

- **Three admin roles:** Admin (full access), Manager (Overview + Operations: Customers, Orders, Processing, Inbox, Drivers), Laundry Tech (Processing only).

- **`role_permissions` DB table:** Stores per-role, per-page boolean access flags. Seeded with defaults for all three roles. Queried at login to determine nav visibility and page access.

- **Dynamic nav visibility:** Nav items now use `data-page` and `data-section` attributes. `applyRoleToNav()` reads from `rolePermissions` cache (loaded at login). Section labels auto-hide when all items in the section are hidden.

- **`showPage()` guard:** Uses `canAccessPage(pageId)` instead of hardcoded `ADMIN_ONLY_PAGES` array. Redirects to first allowed page on denial.

- **Permissions grid UI (Team page):** Admins see a checkbox grid showing all pages × all roles. Clicking a checkbox instantly updates `role_permissions` in the DB. Admin column is locked (always full access).

- **Role management updated:** Invite modal and Change Role modal now offer Admin / Manager / Laundry Tech options instead of Admin / Staff. Role badges have distinct colors (purple/amber/green).

- **Default landing page:** Restricted roles land on their first allowed page (e.g., Laundry Tech goes straight to Processing).

### Mar 13, 2026 (session 2) — Order Schedule polish, Inbox cleanup, address fix

- **Reassignment tags on Order Schedule:** Purple "→ DriverName" pill tag appears next to any stop that's been reassigned to a different driver than the route's default. Uses `route_stops.driver_id` vs `routeLiveDefaultDriverId`.

- **Driver name display on Order Schedule:**
  - Route stop list header shows "DriverName driving" above the stops
  - All Routes group headers show "· DriverName" next to zone/slot label
  - `driver_id` now loaded in the routes query for `loadDailyRuns()`

- **Nav sidebar badges cleaned up:** Removed counters from Customers, Orders, and Processing. Only the Inbox badge (red, unread count) remains — it's the only actionable one.

- **Inbox: email view removed:** Stripped email fetch, email conversation grouping, and channel filter tabs (All/SMS/Email). Inbox is now SMS-only. "+" button always opens SMS compose. Email can be re-added later.

- **SMS compose: customer search:** New search-by-name input above the phone number field. Type a name → dropdown shows matching customers → pick one to auto-fill phone. Manual phone entry still works.

- **Google Maps API fix (customer app):** Address autocomplete and geocoding were silently failing — the Places API and Geocoding API weren't enabled in Google Cloud Console. No code change needed; David enabled the APIs and it started working.

- **Customer app: new address not saved on orders (bug fix):**
  - When a customer typed a new address (not selecting a saved one), `draft.addressId` stayed null because the address was only saved to the DB *after* the order was created
  - The order was inserted with `pickup_address_id: null`, so it showed the old default address
  - Fix: new address is now saved to the `addresses` table BEFORE creating the order, so the address ID is available for the insert
  - Also patched order #84 in the DB (was missing its Berkeley High School address)

- **QA pass:** No High/Medium issues. Dead code from email removal noted for future cleanup. SMS compose search handles XSS correctly via `esc()`.

- **Low-priority QA cleanup (post-QA):**
  - Dead email code removed from admin dashboard — stripped leftover CSS (`.inbox-ch-tabs`, `.inbox-ch-tab`, `.ch-email`), email compose modal HTML, and 6 orphaned JS functions (`setInboxChannel`, `openComposeEmail`, `closeEmailCompose`, `sendComposeEmail`, `openEmailConversation`, `sendEmailReply`). Simplified `renderConvItem()` to remove email branching.
  - SMS compose: added "no phone on file" toast warning when picking a customer with no phone number, preventing silent failure.
  - Customer app: smart address auto-labeling — new addresses now get "Home" → "Work" → "Address N" instead of always "Home", preventing duplicate labels.

### Mar 13, 2026 (session 1) — System simplification + live GPS tracking

- **Live GPS driver tracking (end-to-end):**
  - New `driver_locations` table (one row per driver, UPSERT pattern, Realtime-enabled)
  - Driver app sends GPS every 12s via `navigator.geolocation.watchPosition`
  - Admin dashboard: live driver markers on the Routes map, subscribed via Supabase Realtime

- **Unified single driver model:**
  - Drivers handle both pickup and delivery — no more `pickup_driver_id` / `delivery_driver_id` distinction
  - All app code now uses single `driver_id` on routes and `driver_id` on route_stops
  - Legacy DB columns (`pickup_driver_id`, `delivery_driver_id`) still exist but are unused by app code
  - Reports page simplified to use single driver lookup

- **Driver Schedule as sole source of truth:**
  - Moved Weekly Schedule from Settings/Routes page to Orders page, renamed to "Driver Schedule"
  - Renamed "Daily Schedule" tab to "Order Schedule"
  - Migrated 24 entries from template defaults into `route_driver_schedule`
  - Removed Default Driver concept entirely — no more template `default_pickup_driver_id` fallback
  - All driver assignment logic reads only from `route_driver_schedule`

- **New DB triggers for automation:**
  - `trg_sync_order_status` — auto-advances `orders.status` when all pickup/delivery route_stops are complete
  - `trg_fill_stop_driver` — auto-fills `driver_id` on new route_stops from parent route
  - `trg_sync_customer_cache` — keeps `customers.first_name_cache`/`last_name_cache` in sync with `profiles` table

- **Routing error tracking:**
  - Added `routing_error` text column on orders
  - `auto_route_order()` sets descriptive error when routing fails (no zone, no matching template, etc.)
  - Admin orders table: ⚠️ icon with tooltip on orders with routing errors
  - Admin order detail panel: red banner showing the routing error message

- **Explicit driver_id on route_stops:**
  - Replaced NULL-inherit pattern with explicit `driver_id` on every stop
  - Driver app queries changed from `.is('driver_id', null)` to `.eq('driver_id', currentDriver.id)`

- **Customer orders not appearing in driver app (fixed):**
  - Root cause: seed data routes had NULL driver IDs. Auto-route trigger found existing routes but never backfilled drivers.
  - Fixed trigger + ran one-time UPDATE on all existing routes

- **QA: fixed XSS** — HTML-escape `routing_error` in order detail panel `innerHTML`

- **Edge case testing (9 scenarios tested, 3 bugs found and fixed):**
  1. Order with no zone → was silently unrouted (trigger skipped it). **Fixed:** trigger now sets `routing_error = 'No zone assigned'`
  2. Order on Sunday → correctly fails with routing_error (no Sunday templates). ✅
  3. Order at 2 PM (between AM/PM windows) → silently assigned to AM. Acceptable fallback but noted for future improvement
  4. Route at capacity → overflow order assigned to next template (PM). Works correctly ✅
  5. Driver reassigned on route → existing stops kept old driver. **Fixed:** new `trg_cascade_route_driver` trigger cascades to pending/en_route stops
  6. Status sync (pickup complete → order picked_up, delivery complete → order delivered) ✅
  7. Recurring order with Sunday delivery → delivery stayed on Sunday, failed every cycle. **Fixed:** recurring trigger now bumps both pickup AND delivery off Sundays
  8. Two orders same customer same route → both get separate stops on same route ✅
  9. Duplicate customer on same day/zone → works correctly ✅

### Mar 12, 2026 (session 4) — Daily Schedule overhaul + UX cleanup

- **Driver app: tonight's orders not showing (3 bugs fixed):**
  1. `today()` used `toISOString().split('T')[0]` which returns UTC date — after 5 PM Pacific it returns tomorrow's date. Fixed to use local `getFullYear()/getMonth()/getDate()`.
  2. Address resolution: `route_stops.address_id` is always null. Added customer-based address enrichment — queries `addresses` table via `orders.customer_id` and attaches as `stop._addr`.
  3. RLS policy missing: authenticated drivers had no SELECT on `addresses`. Added `driver_read_stop_addresses` policy.

- **Google Maps API key** added to Supabase Edge Function secrets (`GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`). Optimize route button fixed (was referencing `SUPABASE_URL` instead of `SUPA_URL`).

- **Daily Schedule redesigned as template-driven zone + AM/PM selector:**
  - Row 1: zone pills (All | Berkeley | Oakland) with colored dots matching route template colors
  - Row 2: AM/PM toggle with time labels and NOW/NEXT badges based on current time
  - Auto-selects the most relevant zone+slot (scores: in-window=0, upcoming=distance, past=penalized, routes with stops get priority)
  - "All" pill shows all routes on the map simultaneously, each in its template color

- **Stop rows simplified:** Shows only customer name, address, bags. Removed order number and price. "Assign" text link on the address line for driver reassignment (replaces failed attempts at dots icon and right-click menu).

- **Stop grouping fixed:** Pickups and deliveries mixed within time slots (split by stop_number midpoint), not separated by type.

- **Payment indicator on Orders page:** Green ✓ if paid (has stripe_payment_intent_id and not failed), red ✗ if billing_status=failed, blank otherwise.

- **Map improvements:** Height increased 50% (693px → 1040px). Route line color and pin color now match the route template's color instead of hardcoded purple.

- **Monochrome avatars:** All avatar circles across the dashboard (Customers, Drivers, Team) changed from rainbow colors to white background + black border + black text. Cleaner, more professional.

- **QA pass:** Fixed 3 callers of `selectRunOnMap` missing the new `routeColor` parameter. Bumped Assign link contrast from gray-300 to gray-400 for accessibility.

- **Route template IDs (for reference):** Berkeley AM `656c380d`, Berkeley PM `1468ff14`, Oakland AM `a9d16a68`, Oakland PM `0fe884ef`

### Mar 12, 2026 (session 3) — Auto-routing architecture overhaul
- **Major architecture change: route assignment moved from client JS to DB triggers.**
  The system now auto-routes orders without any admin intervention. Zero manual route creation needed.
- **New DB objects created:**
  1. `route_driver_overrides` table — per-day driver overrides by template + day_of_week + driver_type (pickup/delivery)
  2. `auto_route_order(p_order_id UUID)` function — matches templates by zone + day + time window, finds or creates the dated route, resolves drivers (override → template default → NULL), handles capacity overflow, creates route_stops, links order FKs, syncs `total_stops`
  3. `trg_auto_route_new_order()` trigger — AFTER INSERT on orders, fires for `status='scheduled' AND zone_id IS NOT NULL AND pickup_run_id IS NULL`
  4. `trg_create_recurring_order()` trigger — AFTER UPDATE on orders, fires when status transitions to `delivered` and `recurring_interval` is set. Creates next order (shifted by weekly/biweekly/monthly), skips Sundays (bumps to Monday). New order INSERT fires the auto-route trigger automatically.
- **Updated `orders_source_check`** — expanded from `('scheduled','walk_in')` to include `'customer_app'` and `'recurring'`.
- **Booking cutoff feature:** Added `booking_cutoff_minutes` column to `route_templates` (default 30). Customer app now hides time slots when current time is within the cutoff of the slot's end time (e.g. a 9–11 AM slot with 30min cutoff disappears at 10:30 AM). Configurable per route in admin Routes editor. Previously, slots vanished the moment their start time passed — a 9–11 AM slot disappeared at 9:01 AM.
- **Auto-fail expired orders:** New `auto_fail_expired_orders()` Postgres function runs every 30 minutes via pg_cron. Orders still in pre-pickup status (`scheduled`, `ready_for_pickup`) 2 hours after their pickup window closes → `pickup_failed`. Orders in delivery status (`ready_for_delivery`, `out_for_delivery`) 2 hours after delivery window closes → `delivery_failed`. Both land in admin Issues tab. Sends SMS to customer via pg_net → send-sms edge function inviting them to reschedule.
- **Driver app time-window filtering:** Stops now appear 2 hours before a route's window starts and hide once the auto-fail cron marks them. Incomplete stops from earlier routes carry forward with an "OVERDUE" badge so nothing gets lost. Evening stops no longer clutter the morning view.
- **Updated `orders_status_check`** — added `pickup_failed`, `delivery_failed`, `skipped` to allowed statuses.
- **Updated `route_stops_status_check`** — added `failed` to allowed statuses.
- **Admin Issues tab** — added `delivery_failed` to the filter group (was already showing `pickup_failed`).
- **Removed JS auto-assign from customer app** — the 80-line IIFE with `tmplsForDay()`, `runForDate()`, `nextStopNum()` helpers is gone. Replaced with a comment noting DB trigger handles it.
- **Admin dashboard JS route_stop code retained** — `saveOrder()` route_stop creation stays (needed when admin explicitly picks routes, since trigger only fires when `pickup_run_id IS NULL`). `opSaveRouteAndSlot()` stays (manual route reassignment from order panel).
- **Tested end-to-end:** Inserted a test order for Oakland AM March 12 → trigger auto-created the dated route, assigned driver, created pickup + delivery stops. Then set `recurring_interval='weekly'` and marked delivered → recurring trigger created next order for March 19, which in turn auto-routed to Oakland AM March 19/20. Full chain works.
- **⚠️ Previous operational note is OBSOLETE:** Admins no longer need to pre-create routes. The DB function auto-creates them from templates on demand.

### Mar 12, 2026 (session 2)
- **SendGrid confirmed working** — customer email receipts are live.
- **Root cause of missing routes on customer orders diagnosed and fixed (4 bugs):**
  1. **Dummy test routes had no `template_id`** — auto-assign queries routes by `template_id`; the 4 hardcoded test routes (c1000000... IDs) had `template_id = NULL`, making them invisible. Fixed via SQL UPDATE.
  2. **Customer app: auto-assign only handled pickup, never delivery** — rewrote the auto-assign block to find both pickup and delivery routes (by zone + day-of-week), create both stops, and update both `pickup_run_id` + `delivery_run_id` in one write.
  3. **Admin new-order modal: created route FKs but never created route_stop rows** — fixed to also insert pickup and delivery `route_stop` rows when routes are auto-linked.
  4. **Admin order panel delivery assignment: created no route_stop** — `opSaveRouteAndSlot` already upserted a stop for pickup assignments; mirrored the same logic for delivery.
- **`source` field fixed** — customer-placed orders now correctly set `source = 'customer_app'` (was inheriting DB default `'scheduled'`).
- ~~**⚠️ Important operational note:** Auto-assign only works when admin has already created routes~~ — **OBSOLETE as of session 3, DB triggers now auto-create routes.**
- **Commit:** `791cc6f`

### Mar 12, 2026 (session 1)
- **Admin logout-on-refresh — FINAL root cause and fix:** Despite the `_noopLock` Web Locks fix being confirmed deployed and working, the logout-on-refresh bug persisted on every single refresh. Diagnosed using `[WR Auth]` console logging added to `onAuthStateChange`. Root cause: there was a `localStorage.removeItem('wr-admin-auth')` call guarded by `sessionStorage.getItem('wr-admin-tab')`. The intent was to clear stale sessions on fresh tab opens. The guard was supposed to pass on page refreshes (same tab, sessionStorage preserved). BUT: in Chrome, when the profile fetch fails for any reason, `sessionStorage.setItem('wr-admin-tab', '1')` never runs — so the flag is never set — so the guard fires on the next refresh — so localStorage gets wiped — perpetual logout cycle. Additionally the `_noopLock` fix already eliminated the Web Locks race that this guard was defending against, making the guard pure overhead. **Fix:** Removed the entire `localStorage.removeItem` guard block. Supabase now manages the session lifecycle on its own. Invalid/expired sessions result in `SIGNED_OUT` which correctly shows the login screen. **Commit:** `57cfcb0`. **⚠️ NOT DEPLOYED YET — David needs to run `vercel --prod` from terminal to go live.**
- **Auth diagnostics added (will remove in a future cleanup):** Added `[WR Auth]` console.log lines at every key auth decision point (onAuthStateChange entry, profile fetch success/error, showLoginScreen, null-session timer). Useful for debugging. Commit `afe7436`.
- **`_sessionNullTimer` extended from 2s → 10s:** Commit `afe7436`. Also not yet deployed but bundled with the above.

### Mar 11, 2026
- **QA sweep (all three apps):** Full code review pass. Found two issues fixed below.
- **Customer app safetyTimer wrong element ID:** `document.getElementById('home-screen')` was wrong — correct ID is `screen-home`. Bug caused the login button to always show "Connection timed out" after 30 seconds even when the user was already authenticated. Fixed by correcting the ID.
- **`pickup_failed` missing from admin Issues tab:** `ORDER_FILTER_GROUPS.issues` only had `['skipped','on_hold']`. Orders with `pickup_failed` status were invisible in the dashboard. Fixed by adding `'pickup_failed'` to the array.
- **Admin logout-on-refresh — TRUE root cause (Web Locks deadlock):** Confirmed via live browser testing. Supabase JS v2 acquires a Web Lock named `lock:wr-admin-auth` during auth initialisation and token refresh. On hard refresh (Cmd+R / F5), the new page tries to acquire the same lock before the browser fully releases it from the unloaded page. This causes a **permanent deadlock** — `getSession()` and all subsequent auth calls hang forever (never resolve, never reject). Symptoms: the app loads but never shows any content and never transitions to login screen either. `navigator.locks.query()` confirmed: lock held with 9 pending requests. The previous `sessionStorage` and `INITIAL_SESSION` fixes did not address this at all — the storage was intact, the auth event pipeline just never started. **Fix:** Pass a no-op lock function to `createClient` to bypass Web Locks entirely: `const _noopLock = (name, acquireTimeout, fn) => fn();` used as `auth: { lock: _noopLock }`. Safe for this app — single admin, single tab, no concurrent refresh race conditions to worry about.

## Pending / Next Up
- **Migration 2: drop `customer_type` column + sync trigger** (session 97p3 → next session): After confirming nothing still reads the legacy column for ~24h, drop `trg_sync_customer_type_pricelist` first, then `DROP COLUMN customers.customer_type`. Pre-check: `grep -rn "customer_type"` across all app files and `pg_proc` should return zero hits. Only proceed if clean.
- ~~Twilio A2P 10DLC registration~~ ✅ — Approved 2026-03-16. SMS fully live.

CNAMEs added in Wix DNS (nameservers are Wix-managed). `vercel.json` updated to subdomain routing with path-based fallback. All 3 domains registered in Vercel Production. **⚠️ DNS upgrade (low priority):** Vercel recommends updating CNAMEs from `cname.vercel-dns.com` → `7e86fe29233068d2.vercel-dns-017.com` in Wix. Current setup works fine — update when convenient.
- ~~**Driver app stress test**~~ ✅ — fully tested session 44. All stages passed end-to-end.

- ~~**Zone map unified rendering**~~ ✅ — ST_Union of polygon + city areas = one clean shape per zone; both Zones map and customer map overlay updated (session 44).
- ~~**Multi-polygon zone editing**~~ ✅ — draw multiple non-contiguous areas per zone; saved as MultiPolygon; column type widened (session 44).
- Route picker fine-tuning — continuing session 8 (edge cases, UX polish)
- SMS automation Phase 2 — natural-language cancellations ("cancel Thursday") — needs `conversations` table for multi-turn state
- **Inactivity nudge SMS (back burner — build after ~1 month of operations):** One-time SMS to customers with no delivered order in 45 days. SMS only (requires `sms_consent_at`). Stamp `inactivity_nudge_sent_at` on customer so it never re-sends. Message content TBD. Same timeline as re-enabling automated reminder cron jobs — wait until platform is stable.
- **Re-enable automated reminder cron jobs (back burner — ~1 month of operations):** Re-create `wr-reminder-evening` and `wr-reminder-morning` with proper scoping (only customers with real orders). Re-enable SMS templates one at a time. See "SMS CURRENTLY DISABLED" section for full checklist.
- **Launderer reporting Phase 2** — date range mode (week/month/custom) on the launderer history panel; data model is complete, UI-only work
- **Launderer reporting Phase 3** — cross-folder aggregate view: side-by-side bags/lbs/orders/revenue for all active folders over a selected period (pay period reporting)
- ~~Design decision: customer-initiated skips + `cancelled_by` field~~ ✅ — fully implemented session 5
- ~~Customer email receipt (SendGrid)~~ ✅ — confirmed working

## Test Order SQL Template

When inserting test orders directly via SQL, use this template so that DB triggers fire correctly and the order behaves like a real customer-placed one. **Replace the placeholder values** with real IDs from the DB.

```sql
-- ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
-- ║  TEST ORDER INSERT — copy, fill in placeholders, run once   ║
-- ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
--
-- REQUIRED: fill in customer_id, address_id, zone_id, and dates.
-- The auto-route trigger handles everything else (route, stops, driver).
--
-- Zone IDs (for reference):
--   Oakland:       fbc4627b-7026-44e2-9b00-2c3c867f4460
--   Berkeley:      2dfc9835-3528-4143-bfa1-c6a9961bb3c2
--   Alameda:       9d624c91-2991-45d0-bcdd-db0906ad88c2
--   San Francisco: 670d7bb1-68f0-4696-9b8c-a726d8c85da4
--   Hayward:       39d9a0c0-c906-45f6-a8ab-6fe4a992e026

INSERT INTO orders (
  customer_id,
  status,
  total_bags,
  total_amount,
  pickup_window_start,        -- UTC timestamp (Pacific + 7 in winter, + 8 in summer)
  pickup_window_end,
  delivery_window_start,
  delivery_window_end,
  zone_id,
  pickup_address_id,
  delivery_address_id,
  source,
  line_items,
  recurring_interval          -- NULL, 'weekly', 'biweekly', or 'monthly'
) VALUES (
  '________-____-____-____-____________',   -- customer_id (required)
  'scheduled',                               -- must be 'scheduled' for trigger to fire
  2,                                         -- total_bags
  0,                                         -- total_amount (set when charged)
  '2026-03-__T__:00:00Z',                   -- pickup start (UTC)
  '2026-03-__T__:00:00Z',                   -- pickup end (UTC)
  '2026-03-__T__:00:00Z',                   -- delivery start (UTC, typically +1 day)
  '2026-03-__T__:00:00Z',                   -- delivery end (UTC, typically +1 day)
  '________-____-____-____-____________',   -- zone_id (required — see list above)
  '________-____-____-____-____________',   -- pickup_address_id
  '________-____-____-____-____________',   -- delivery_address_id (same as pickup if identical)
  'customer_app',                            -- source: customer_app, scheduled, walk_in, recurring
  '[]',                                      -- line_items (JSONB array)
  NULL                                       -- recurring_interval (NULL for one-time)
);

-- ⚠️ DO NOT set pickup_run_id or delivery_run_id — leave them NULL
--    so the auto_route_on_insert trigger fires and assigns routes.
--
-- ⚠️ Pickup time must fall within a route template's window for the
--    order's zone + day-of-week, or no route will be assigned.
--    Current windows: AM = 07:00-11:00, PM = 18:00-22:00 Pacific
--
-- To verify it worked:
-- SELECT id, pickup_run_id, delivery_run_id FROM orders WHERE id = '<new-id>';
